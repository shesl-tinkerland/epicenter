# Matter Multi-Vault via the Routing Layer

**Date**: 2026-06-06
**Status**: Draft (not started)
**Owner**: Braden
**Branch**: suggest `matter-multi-vault-routing` off `matter-typed-markdown-editor`
**Builds on**: the single-vault work in `matter-typed-markdown-editor` (commits `ba0d611a1`..`fdaeee480`), especially `fdaeee480` which gave the vault `whenReady` + `dispose` and the `vaultSession` singleton this spec replaces.

## One Sentence

Make the URL the open vault: each vault is a `/vault/[id]` route whose component owns the live watcher (construct on mount, dispose on destroy), a persisted string list is the set of open tabs, and SvelteKit's router replaces the bespoke `vaultSession` lifecycle entirely.

The reader should get the current truth in one minute (One Sentence + Asymmetric Win), the model in five (Architecture + Decisions), the execution path in fifteen (Implementation Plan + Handoff).

## Overview

Matter today opens one folder at a time. This spec adds multiple open vaults with a tab strip, by moving "which vault is active" into the URL and "the live watcher" into a per-route component lifecycle. The only durable state added is a small persisted list of opened folders.

## Motivation

### Current State

After `fdaeee480`, the open vault lives in a module singleton and the page reads it:

```ts
// src/lib/vault.svelte.ts  (today)
function createVault(path) {
  // ... self-watches at construction; exposes whenReady + dispose
}
function createVaultSession() {
  let current = $state<Vault>();   // exactly ONE open vault
  let opening = $state(false);
  let openError = $state<string>();
  async function open() {
    const path = await openFolderDialog();
    if (path) { current?.dispose(); current = createVault(path); }
  }
  return { get current(){...}, get opening(){...}, get openError(){...}, open };
}
export const vaultSession = createVaultSession();
```

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+page.svelte  (today) -->
{#if vaultSession.current}
  {@const vault = vaultSession.current}
  {#await vault.whenReady} ...loading {:then _} <FolderGrid {vault} ...> {:catch error} ... {/await}
{:else}
  ...open a folder
{/if}
```

This is clean for one vault. The constraints it cannot meet:

1. **One vault only**: `current` is a single slot. Tabs need many.
2. **No navigable identity**: there is no back/forward, no deep-link, no "which vault am I in" that survives a reload.
3. **If you bolt on multi-vault naively**, you reinvent a `Map<id, Vault>`, an `activeId` `$state`, and a manual dispose policy: state the router already manages.

### Desired State

```txt
the URL  /vault/[id]   ->  WHICH vault is active     (free: back/forward, deep-link, no activeId state)
persisted list         ->  WHICH vaults are open     ({id, path, name}[] = the tabs, survives relaunch)
the route component     ->  the LIVE vault for [id]   (construct on mount, dispose on destroy)
```

`vaultSession` is deleted. The vault core (`createVault`, `whenReady`, `dispose`, `FolderGridVault`, `createWhereFilter`) is unchanged; it was built to be exactly the seam a keyed route consumes.

## Research Findings

### SvelteKit routing for a Tauri SPA (grounded against `sveltejs/kit` via DeepWiki, 2026-06-06)

Matter is `ssr = false` (`src/routes/+layout.ts`) with `adapter-static`: a pure client-side SPA. The decisive facts:

| Question | Finding | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Do client-side dynamic routes need config? | Yes: `adapter-static` needs a `fallback` HTML (e.g. `index.html` / `200.html`); the server serves it for any unprerendered path and the client router takes over. | DeepWiki `sveltejs/kit` |
| Does `+page.svelte` remount on `[id]` change? | No. SvelteKit **reuses** the component instance across param changes. You must wrap the resource owner in `{#key page.params.id}` so `onMount`/`onDestroy` fire per id. | DeepWiki `sveltejs/kit` |
| Where does a live, non-serializable resource go? | The **component**, not `load()`. `load()` returns serializable data only. Construct the watcher in the keyed component; `load()` may resolve `id -> {path, name}` and `error(404)` on unknown. | DeepWiki `sveltejs/kit` |
| Programmatic navigation after opening? | `goto()` from `$app/navigation`. | DeepWiki `sveltejs/kit` |
| `page.params` access | `page` from `$app/state` in current kit (verify the exact import against installed version; older code used the `$page` store from `$app/stores`). | Class 1, verify on start |

**Key finding**: the SvelteKit docs already describe this exact shape. `{#key page.params.id}` is the documented mechanism for per-param resource lifecycle; it is the [svelte skill's keyed-resource pattern](../.agents/skills/svelte/references/lifecycle-and-reactivity.md) ("let the parent own mount/unmount; open sync in the child; gate readiness with `{#await}`") lifted from a component to the router.

**Implication**: the radical-simple design is also the framework-native one. Reaching for a global registry is fighting the router.

### Route-owned vs global registry

| | Route-owned (recommended) | Global registry `Map<id, Vault>` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who owns lifecycle | the router (`{#key}` + `onDestroy`) | you (manual create/dispose policy) |
| Live watchers | one at a time (active route) | N (all open tabs) |
| Tab switch | re-open + re-seed the new vault | instant (already live) |
| Background changes | seen on next visit (re-seed) | live | 
| OS resources | one `notify` watcher | N watchers (inotify/FSEvents pressure) |
| Bespoke state | a persisted string list only | list + `Map` + `activeId` + dispose policy |
| Fits SvelteKit | yes, native | no, you keep state the router wants to tear down |

**Key finding**: matter's lifecycle bench (`scripts/bench-lifecycle.ts`, see `specs/20260605T145734-matter-live-projection-lifecycle.md`) shows reconcile is sub-frame to ~50k rows and the cost is the IPC seed **payload**, not CPU. Re-seed on tab switch is cheap at drafting scale.

**Implication**: re-open-on-switch is the default; a registry is a later, scoped addition only if a feature needs background liveness.

## The Asymmetric Win

```txt
Refuse:   background vaults staying live while their tab is inactive        (~15% of the feature)
Collapse: the Map<id,Vault>, the activeId state, the manual dispose policy,
          and the imperative open/current/swap  ->  all of it becomes the router  (~85%)
```

One line: **the URL is the active vault, a persisted string list is the open vaults, and SvelteKit's router is the entire live-vault lifecycle.** Giving up background watching is what lets every piece of bespoke multi-vault state disappear. Re-seed-on-view is also a safety property: it is the same "pure function of truth, full reconcile, no silent divergence" rule matter already applies to the SQLite mirror, now applied to tabs.

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Class | Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Active vault identity | 2 coherence | the URL `/vault/[id]` | URL is the natural home for navigable state; frees back/forward/deep-link; no `activeId` `$state`. |
| Vault lifetime | 2 coherence | route-owned, one live at a time | router + `{#key}` + `onDestroy` is the lifecycle; refuse background watching (the asymmetric win). |
| Tab switch behavior | 3 taste | re-open + re-seed | cheap at matter's scale (bench); re-seed = always-current safety. Constraint: brief loading flash on switch; large-folder seed payload. |
| `id -> path` resolution | 1 evidence | `+page.ts` `load()` returns `{path, name}` or `error(404)` | DeepWiki: serializable data + clean not-found; component stays lifecycle-only. (Open Q: could read the singleton in-component instead.) |
| Live vault construction | 1 evidence | in the keyed component, never `load()` | DeepWiki: non-serializable resources cannot leave `load()`. |
| Slug shape | 2 coherence | opaque short id, not the raw path | filesystem paths contain `/` and special chars; `%2F` in URLs is fragile. `id -> path` lives in the persisted list. |
| Open-vaults persistence | 3 taste | `createPersistedState` from `@epicenter/svelte` (localStorage) | repo-idiomatic per the svelte skill; survives reload; gives reopen-on-relaunch (watch_folder takes an unrestricted absolute path, verified `watch.rs`). Add the dep if absent; a tiny hand-rolled wrapper is acceptable. |
| Vault core (`createVault`/`whenReady`/`dispose`/`FolderGridVault`/`createWhereFilter`) | 2 coherence | unchanged | built in `fdaeee480` to be exactly this seam. |
| `/demo` route | 2 coherence | unchanged | its own synchronous in-memory vault; orthogonal. |
| Registry of live vaults | Deferred | Deferred | add only when a feature needs background liveness (cross-vault search, inactive-tab badges). |

## Architecture

```txt
src/routes/
  +layout.svelte         tab strip: reads openVaults (persisted), <a href="/vault/{id}">,
                         active = page.params.id, "+" button = open(); renders {@render children()}
  +layout.ts             export const ssr = false   (already present)
  +page.svelte           index: "open a folder" onboarding  (Open Q: or redirect to last open vault)
  vault/[id]/
    +page.ts             load({ params }): openVaults.find(params.id) -> {path, name} | error(404)
    +page.svelte         {#key data.path} <VaultView path={data.path} /> {/key}
    VaultView.svelte     the OLD +page body, verbatim minus the singleton reads:
                           const vault = createVault(path)
                           $effect(() => () => vault.dispose())   // dispose on destroy
                           {#await vault.whenReady} spinner {:then _} <FolderGrid> {:catch} couldn't-watch
                           const filter = createWhereFilter(); $effect(() => filter.resolve(vault))
  demo/                  unchanged

src/lib/
  open-vaults.svelte.ts  persisted {id,path,name}[] singleton + open() (dialog -> mint id -> push -> goto) + close()
  vault.svelte.ts        createVault / whenReady / dispose / FolderGridVault   UNCHANGED
                         vaultSession  ->  DELETED
  where-filter.svelte.ts UNCHANGED (now one filter per VaultView = a free per-tab WHERE clause)

svelte.config.js         adapter-static { fallback: 'index.html' }   (required for the dynamic route)
```

Open flow:

```txt
"+" / "Open folder"
  -> openVaults.open()
    -> openFolderDialog()  (native picker, returns absolute path | null)
    -> mint opaque id; push { id, path, name: basename(path) } to the persisted list
    -> goto('/vault/' + id)
      -> /vault/[id] load resolves id -> { path }
        -> VaultView mounts: createVault(path) self-watches; {#await whenReady} -> grid
```

Switch flow:

```txt
click tab  ->  <a href="/vault/{otherId}">
  -> SvelteKit reuses +page.svelte; {#key data.path} sees a new key
    -> old VaultView onDestroy -> vault.dispose()  (old OS watcher stops)
    -> new VaultView mount -> createVault(newPath) -> re-seed
```

## Call Sites: before and after

### The page body moves into a keyed route component

**Before** (`src/routes/+page.svelte`, today): reads `vaultSession.current`, gates with `{#await}`.

**After**: `src/routes/vault/[id]/+page.svelte` is just the keyed wrapper; the body becomes `VaultView.svelte`:

```svelte
<!-- vault/[id]/+page.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { page } from '$app/state';      // verify import vs installed kit
  import type { PageData } from './$types';
  import VaultView from './VaultView.svelte';
  let { data }: { data: PageData } = $props();
</script>
{#key data.path}
  <VaultView path={data.path} />
{/key}
```

```svelte
<!-- vault/[id]/VaultView.svelte  (the current +page body, de-singletoned) -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { createVault } from '$lib/vault.svelte';
  import { createWhereFilter } from '$lib/where-filter.svelte';
  let { path }: { path: string } = $props();
  const vault = createVault(path);
  $effect(() => () => vault.dispose());   // dispose when this keyed instance is torn down
  const filter = createWhereFilter();
  $effect(() => filter.resolve(vault));
  const view = $derived(vault.read.view);
</script>
{#await vault.whenReady}
  ...spinner...
{:then _}
  ...{#if vault.writeError}...{/if} <FolderGrid {vault} matchedFileNames={filter.matchedFileNames} />
{:catch error}
  ...couldn't watch {vault.folderName}...
{/await}
```

**Semantic shift to flag**: `filter.resolve(vault)` now takes a non-undefined `vault` (the route guarantees one), so the `vault | undefined` branch inside `resolve` is dead on this path. Leave `resolve` tolerant (the demo and the cold index may still pass undefined), or tighten it; grill which.

### Open action moves from the singleton to the list

**Before**: `vaultSession.open()` sets `current`.

**After** (`src/lib/open-vaults.svelte.ts`):

```ts
async function open(): Promise<void> {
  const path = await openFolderDialog();
  if (path === null) return;
  const id = mintId();                                  // opaque, URL-safe
  list.push({ id, path, name: basename(path) });        // persisted
  await goto(`/vault/${id}`);
}
```

## Implementation Plan

Follow Build, Prove, Remove: the old `vaultSession` path stays on disk until the new path is proven, so rollback is one revert.

### Phase 1: Build the route skeleton

- [x] **1.1** Add `adapter-static` `fallback` in `svelte.config.js`; confirm a hard refresh on `/vault/anything` boots the SPA.
  > **Note**: `fallback: 'index.html'` was already present. Confirmed statically via `bun run build`: the SPA shell (`build/index.html`) is emitted and the dynamic route builds with no prerender error. Live hard-refresh is part of the `tauri dev` smoke (3.2).
- [x] **1.2** `src/lib/open-vaults.svelte.ts`: persisted `{id,path,name}[]`, `open()`, `close(id)`, a `get(id)` helper.
  > **Deviation**: hand-rolled localStorage wrapper instead of `createPersistedState`. Matter never imports `@epicenter/svelte` and `createPersistedState` requires a `StandardSchemaV1` schema (typebox v1 is not one, and matter's own `src` never imports raw typebox). The spec blessed "a tiny hand-rolled wrapper." It guards reads with `browser`, validates the parsed shape (corrupt store degrades to no tabs), and persists on every change. `mintId()` is inlined as `crypto.randomUUID()` (opaque, URL-safe, collision-free) rather than a one-line named helper. `openFolderDialog` moved here from `vault.svelte.ts` (its only caller was `vaultSession`).
  > **Added decision**: `open()` dedups by path. Reopening a folder already in the list focuses its existing tab instead of minting a duplicate (tabs show one at a time and only the active one is live, so a duplicate would be dead). Class 3 taste.
- [x] **1.3** `vault/[id]/+page.ts`: `load` resolves `params.id -> {path,name}` from the list or `error(404)`.
- [x] **1.4** `vault/[id]/VaultView.svelte`: move the current `+page.svelte` body here, de-singletoned (props `path`), dispose via `$effect` cleanup.
  > **Note**: `createVault` is now exported from `vault.svelte.ts` (was private to `vaultSession`). The keyed-prop capture uses the repo-idiomatic `// svelte-ignore state_referenced_locally` (same pattern as fuji's `EntryBodyEditor`). `where-filter.svelte.ts` is unchanged: `resolve` stays tolerant of `undefined` per Open Q6.
- [x] **1.5** `vault/[id]/+page.svelte`: `{#key data.path}<VaultView path={data.path}/>{/key}`.

### Phase 2: Build the shell

> **Deviation (whole phase)**: the tab strip lives in a `(vaults)` route-group layout (`src/routes/(vaults)/+layout.svelte`), not the root `+layout.svelte`, and the index moved to `(vaults)/+page.svelte`. Reason: the spec wants `/demo` orthogonal/unchanged, but a layout cannot be un-inherited, so a root-level tab strip would force itself onto `/demo`. The group puts index + `vault/[id]` under the tab-strip shell while `demo/` stays a sibling with only the root providers layout (no path-sniffing conditional). The root `+layout.svelte` (Tooltip + ModeWatcher) is unchanged.

- [x] **2.1** `(vaults)/+layout.svelte`: tab strip from `openVaults`, active = `page.params.id`, "+" calls `open()`, per-tab close button (`close(id)` + `goto` to a neighbor, else `/`, if it was active).
- [x] **2.2** `(vaults)/+page.svelte` (index): onboarding "open a folder" (Open Q2 resolved to (a) for v1).
- [x] **2.3** `(vaults)/vault/[id]/+error.svelte`: the `error(404)` "this vault isn't open" state with a reopen affordance.

### Phase 3: Prove

- [ ] **3.1** `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`, `cargo test` green.
- [ ] **3.2** `bun tauri dev` smoke test (the only real proof of the watcher lifecycle): open two folders, switch tabs (old watcher stops, new seeds), close a tab, relaunch (vaults reopen from the persisted list), open a since-deleted folder (catch branch).

### Phase 4: Remove

- [ ] **4.1** Delete `vaultSession` and `openVault` from `vault.svelte.ts`; delete the old single-vault `+page.svelte` body.
- [ ] **4.2** Straggler sweep (no `vaultSession` refs); update the vault doc comment and memory.

## Edge Cases

### Relaunch with persisted vaults
1. App boots at `/` (or last route via SvelteKit), the persisted list has N entries.
2. Navigating to `/vault/[id]` re-runs `createVault(path)`; the watcher re-arms (path is unrestricted, verified `watch.rs`).
3. Expected: vaults reopen. If a path was deleted/moved, `whenReady` rejects -> `{:catch}`.

### Cold deep-link to an unknown id
1. `/vault/abc` where `abc` is not in the persisted list.
2. `load` throws `error(404)`.
3. Expected: `+error.svelte` "not open, reopen?" (not a crash).

### Closing the active tab
1. User closes the tab they are viewing.
2. `close(id)` removes it; the route is now stale.
3. Expected: `goto` to a sibling tab, or to `/` if none. Decide in 2.1.

### Rapid tab flipping on a huge folder
1. Many switches; each re-seeds.
2. The seed IPC payload is the cost.
3. Expected: acceptable at drafting scale; if it bites, add a small LRU keep-alive (Open Q), not a registry.

## Open Questions

1. **`load()` vs reading the singleton in the component for `id -> path`.**
   - Options: (a) `+page.ts load` returns `{path,name}` + `error(404)`; (b) `VaultView` reads `openVaults.get(id)` and shows inline not-found.
   - **Recommendation**: (a) for the clean error boundary and framework-native param resolution, but (b) is fewer files and arguably better desktop UX. Leave open; grill both.

2. **Index route `/` behavior.**
   - Options: (a) onboarding "open a folder"; (b) redirect to the last open vault; (c) a vault dashboard/grid of tiles.
   - **Recommendation**: (a) for v1, (b) as a nicety. (c) is a separate feature.

3. **Keep-alive on tab switch.**
   - Context: re-seed flash. A small LRU (keep the last 1-2 disposed vaults warm for a few seconds) removes the flash without a full registry.
   - **Recommendation**: defer until the flash actually annoys; if added, model it on `createDisposableCache` (see `project_body_docs_clean_break`), not a hand-rolled map.

4. **Tabs vs native Tauri windows.**
   - Context: each vault could be a native window instead of an in-app tab.
   - **Recommendation**: in-app tabs (one window, routes) for v1; native multi-window is a bigger product call. Note it, do not build it.

5. **Tab order / session restore fidelity.**
   - Should tab order persist? Should the app restore the active tab on relaunch?
   - **Recommendation**: persist the list order; restoring the active tab is a nicety (store `lastActiveId`).

6. **Should `createWhereFilter` / `filter.resolve` tighten to a non-optional vault on the route path?**
   - The route guarantees a vault, so the `undefined` branch is dead there.
   - **Recommendation**: keep `resolve` tolerant (demo + index still pass undefined) unless the grill finds a cleaner split.

## Adjacent Work

- Registry of live vaults: not required now; add only for a feature that needs background liveness (cross-vault search, inactive-tab change badges).
- Native multi-window: not required; a different product direction.
- Reopen-active-tab-on-launch: not required; cheap nicety once the list persists.

## Decisions Log

- Keep `createWhereFilter` per-`VaultView` (one filter instance per tab): each tab gets its own WHERE clause, which is correct, not a cost.
  Revisit when: a feature needs a shared cross-tab filter.
- Keep re-seed-on-switch (no keep-alive): simplicity + always-current safety over instant switching.
  Revisit when: the loading flash is measured as annoying, or a folder is large enough that the seed payload stalls switching.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Open two folders; both appear as tabs; the URL reflects the active one.
- [ ] Switching tabs disposes the old watcher and seeds the new (verify in `tauri dev`: only one watcher live).
- [ ] Back/forward navigates between vaults.
- [ ] Relaunch reopens the persisted vaults; a deleted folder shows the `{:catch}` state, not a crash.
- [ ] A cold deep-link to an unknown id shows the `error(404)` state.
- [ ] `vaultSession` is gone; `bun run typecheck` + `bun test` + `cargo test` green; live smoke test passes.
- [ ] The vault core, `FolderGrid`, `where-filter`, and `/demo` are unchanged.

## Handoff Prompt

Give the following to a fresh agent with enough time to grill before building. It is self-contained.

```txt
You are implementing multi-vault support for the Matter app (apps/matter) in the
epicenter monorepo. Read specs/20260606T163601-matter-multi-vault-routing.md in
full first; it is the source of truth. Work on a new branch
`matter-multi-vault-routing` off `matter-typed-markdown-editor`.

CONTEXT YOU INHERIT (do not redo):
- Matter is a Tauri + SvelteKit SPA (ssr = false, adapter-static). A "vault" is a
  live folder watcher (Rust `notify` + an IPC Channel + an in-memory SvelteMap).
- The vault core already exposes the exact seam this needs: createVault(path)
  self-watches on construction and exposes `whenReady` (Promise) + `dispose()`;
  `FolderGridVault` keeps the grid vault-agnostic; `createWhereFilter()` is a
  page-owned filter. These shipped in commits ba0d611a1..fdaeee480. Keep them
  unless your grilling proves a better seam.
- Today a `vaultSession` singleton holds ONE `current` vault. You are replacing it
  with the routing layer. The target is: URL = active vault (/vault/[id]),
  persisted {id,path,name}[] list = open tabs, route component = the live vault
  (construct on mount, dispose on destroy via {#key page.params.id}).

YOUR JOB IS TO GRILL FIRST, THEN BUILD. Spend real time here.
1. Before writing code, grill the design for the asymmetric win. Load and apply:
   grill-me / fresh-eyes-grill (stress the state machine and lifecycle),
   radical-options (is there an even smaller shape?), cohesive-clean-breaks and
   greenfield-clean-breaks (what 15% do we refuse to delete 85%?), one-sentence-test
   (can you still name it in one sentence after each change?), collapse-pass.
   Re-open the spec's Open Questions and resolve each with evidence or a logged
   Class-3 keep. If a sub-agent or a grill round finds a simpler shape than the
   route-owned + reload-on-switch default, take it and update the spec.
2. GROUND every SvelteKit routing claim against the docs before relying on it.
   Ask DeepWiki narrow questions against sveltejs/kit (and sveltejs/svelte for
   runes), and verify decisive details against the installed types/source. The
   spec lists the facts already grounded (adapter-static fallback; component reuse
   across params so {#key} is required; non-serializable resources go in the
   component not load(); goto; error(404)); re-verify anything you change and the
   exact `page`/params import for the installed kit version.
3. Honor the constraints that shape everything: a vault is a live resource and a
   URL is a string, so the URL holds an opaque id (not the raw path); the native
   folder dialog cannot be triggered from a URL, so opening is always a user
   action that mints an id and goto()s. Re-seed-on-switch is the default; do NOT
   add a global Map<id,Vault> registry unless a concrete feature demands background
   liveness (and then scope it + write the dispose policy).

EXECUTION DISCIPLINE:
- Build, Prove, Remove (spec Implementation Plan). Do not delete vaultSession until
  the new path is proven; rollback should be one revert.
- Standalone commits, conventional messages, no AI attribution, no em/en dashes.
  Stage specific files only (git add <paths>; never `git add .`). This worktree
  may have concurrent human edits: re-read ground truth before each edit and
  commit with explicit paths.
- Gates after each wave: `bun run typecheck`, `bun test`, and `cargo test` in
  apps/matter/src-tauri when Rust/ts-rs is touched. The watcher lifecycle is only
  truly verifiable under `bun tauri dev`: do the live smoke test in the spec's
  Success Criteria (two vaults, tab switch disposes old + seeds new, close,
  relaunch reopens, deleted folder -> catch, unknown id -> 404) and report it
  honestly as the real proof.
- When done, run a post-implementation-review pass and update the memory file
  project_typed_markdown_grid_editor with what shipped and what was deferred.

Deliver the asymmetric win: the URL is the active vault, a persisted string list
is the open vaults, and SvelteKit's router is the entire live-vault lifecycle.
If you cannot keep that one-sentence description true, stop and surface why.
```
