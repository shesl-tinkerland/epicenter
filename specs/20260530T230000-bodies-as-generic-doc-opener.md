# Bodies as app-owned doc caches (delete the body subsystem, invert control)

**Date**: 2026-05-30
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED and affirmed by PR #1868. The asymmetric
move: delete the schema-derived body subsystem and replace it with a single app-owned
`createDisposableCache` keyed by the app's own id, where the build closure derives the
guid, attaches the shared type, and wires the updatedAt bump. No new library primitive.
Grounded against the repo, the git history of every prior doc-opener shape, and the
convergent prior art (automerge-repo `repo.find(url)`, Jazz `LocalNode.load(id)`) via
DeepWiki.
PR #1868 clarified the daemon and markdown edges: Fuji's daemon reads body docs one
row at a time, destroys them, and writes markdown as a derived projection of root row
frontmatter plus body doc text. Markdown import back into Fuji body Y.Docs is follow-up
work, not current daemon behavior.
**Owner**: Workspace platform

## Relationship to prior specs

SUPERSEDES (mechanism)  20260530T180000-schema-declared-body-docs.md
                        Deletes column.body, the BodyMarker partition, bodyDocGuids
                        derivation, attachBodyCache, the generic schema-enumerating
                        daemon. Keeps the deterministic docGuid scheme (parity) and the
                        Yjs grounding (a live shared type cannot live in an encrypted row).

SUPERSEDES (mechanism)  20260530T220000-body-docs-clean-break.md  (Part 1 only)
                        That spec polished the body subsystem (delete codec, online(),
                        fold touch) but KEPT it. This deletes the subsystem instead.
                        Part 2 (the encryption gradation) STILL HOLDS, restated below.

RESTORES (the thesis)   20260420T230100-collapse-document-framework.md
                        "Apps own content-doc construction directly; the framework must
                        not own Y.Doc construction or force a registry." This spec returns
                        to that exact shape: buildEntryContentDoc as a createDisposableCache
                        builder, app-owned, keyed by the app's id.
```

## One sentence

A "body" is not a kind of column the framework must understand; it is just another
`Y.Doc`, so each app builds its OWN typed cache (`createDisposableCache` keyed by the
app's id) whose build closure derives the guid, attaches whatever shared type it wants,
and wires any side effects, which deletes the entire body subsystem (`column.body`, the
codec, the derivation, the generic body cache, the schema-enumerating daemon) with no new
library primitive at all.

---

## The reframe (why every prior shape optimized the wrong axis)

Every iteration asked: "how does the framework KNOW a field is a body and read it FOR me
with zero caller knowledge?" That question forces schema declaration, a partition, a
derivation, a reader/codec, and a generic daemon. The git history is six shapes of
answering it (createContentDocStore -> .withDocument -> client.documents -> defineDocument
-> the refused workspace.docs registry -> column.body), each heavier than the last for the
same one feature.

The inversion asks the opposite: "what is the SMALLEST thing the framework owes, and can
the APP own the rest?" The answer turns out to be: the framework owes NOTHING new. The app
already has `createDisposableCache`. A body is just:

```txt
createDisposableCache((id) => buildEntryContentDoc(id))
  where buildEntryContentDoc derives the guid, attaches rich text, wires the touch.
```

This is the convergent prior art at the right altitude: automerge-repo `repo.find(url)`
and Jazz `LocalNode.load(id)` are "address by id, cache by id, caller owns the type." We
do the same, except the id is the app's typed row id (not an opaque url), the guid is
DERIVED from it (decision D2), and the cache is app-owned and typed (not a global
registry). Verified convergent, not a guess.

The cost we accept (the refused 10 percent): the daemon is no longer a generic binary that
materializes ANY app's bodies from schema with zero app code. Each app writes a ~12-line
materialize loop. At 1 to 3 apps this is trivial; the generic daemon was speculative
generality for a multi-app product that does not exist yet. When it does, an app-owned
cache is still its substrate; schema-derivation can return as a thin layer ON TOP.

---

## The layers (there are only three, and two already exist)

```txt
ISO (already exists)   entryContentDocGuid(id) = docGuid(FUJI_ID,'entries',id,'content')
                       attachRichText(ydoc) -> { binding, read }
                       The row->doc link + the shared type. Shared by browser AND daemon.
                       Nothing new; both live in the repo today.

BROWSER (the cache)    const entryBodies = createDisposableCache((id: EntryId) => {...})
                       Built INSIDE openFujiBrowser, closing over signedIn + tables.
                       Keyed by EntryId. Exposed on the bundle as `fuji.entryBodies`.
                       This is the ONLY place "a Fuji entry body" is defined.

DAEMON (no cache)      a loop: for each entry, build a Y.Doc, attach yjs-log + sync, read,
                       destroy. The daemon never opens the same guid twice concurrently,
                       so it needs NO cache (two honest lifecycles, per 180000 decision G).
```

```txt
YJS DOC GRAPH (unchanged: every doc a separate top-level guid-addressed Y.Doc)

  ROOT  guid="epicenter-fuji"   EncryptedYkvLww tables.entries (row VALUES = ciphertext)
        row k7x9 = { id, title, updatedAt, ... }   <- NO body column anymore
              |
              |  entryContentDocGuid(k7x9)  (pure fn, identical to today: NO data move)
              v
  BODY  guid="epicenter-fuji.entries.k7x9.content"   getXmlFragment('content') via attachRichText
        opened on demand by entryBodies.open(k7x9); plaintext-in-doc, enc at-rest IDB only
```

---

## Why a cache at all (the one piece worth defending)

A cache means "same id -> same Y.Doc." Drop it and two surfaces opening the same entry
(the editor + a markdown export triggered while editing, or a future split-pane preview)
each `new Y.Doc({sameGuid})`:

```txt
two Y.Docs, same guid, one tab:
  IDB    per-guid, but does NOT live-push one doc's writes into the other doc in-tab
  relay  reconciles them, but only when ONLINE, via a round-trip
  offline -> they DIVERGE until reconnect
```

That is a correctness footgun, not just waste. `createDisposableCache` makes it impossible
for one cent (refcount + grace window). This is exactly why automerge-repo and Jazz cache
by id. The BROWSER needs it (concurrent surfaces); the DAEMON does not (one guid at a
time). So "do we track documents?" -> browser yes, daemon no.

## Before / after call sites

### Schema (apps/fuji/.../index.ts)

```ts
// BEFORE (v3 columns record)
content: column.body(richText()),
// AFTER
// (deleted. entries are plain metadata. The row->doc link is entryContentDocGuid(id),
//  already present below and unchanged. column.body was always partitioned OUT of the
//  stored row, so deleting it changes ZERO stored bytes and needs no migration.)
```

### Browser composition (apps/fuji/.../browser.ts)

```ts
// AFTER. Built inside openFujiBrowser, closing over signedIn + workspace.tables.
// Optional local DRY helper so the ROOT doc and the body builder share the pair:
const wire = (ydoc: Y.Doc, actions: Actions = {}) => {
  const idb  = attachLocalStorage(ydoc, { server: signedIn.server, ownerId: signedIn.ownerId, keyring: signedIn.keyring });
  const sync = openCollaboration(ydoc, {
    url: roomWsUrl({ baseURL: signedIn.baseURL, ownerId: signedIn.ownerId, guid: ydoc.guid, deviceId }),
    openWebSocket: signedIn.openWebSocket, onReconnectSignal: signedIn.onReconnectSignal,
    waitFor: idb.whenLoaded, actions,
  });
  return { idb, sync };
};

const { idb, sync: collaboration } = wire(workspace.ydoc, workspace.actions);   // root: opened once

// The ONE place "a Fuji entry body" is defined. Typed to EntryId. Browser-only.
const entryBodies = createDisposableCache((id: EntryId) => {
  const ydoc = new Y.Doc({ guid: entryContentDocGuid(id), gc: true });   // derive the guid INSIDE
  const { idb: bodyIdb, sync: bodySync } = wire(ydoc);                    // actions: {} for bodies
  const text = attachRichText(ydoc);                                      // caller picks the shared type
  const off  = onLocalUpdate(ydoc, () =>                                  // the touch, in app code
    workspace.tables.entries.update(id, { updatedAt: DateTimeString.now() }));
  return {
    ydoc, binding: text.binding, read: text.read, whenLoaded: bodyIdb.whenLoaded,
    [Symbol.dispose]() { off(); bodyIdb /* disposed via ydoc.destroy chain */; ydoc.destroy(); },
  };
});

// expose on the bundle:  return defineWorkspace({ ...workspace, idb, collaboration, entryBodies, ... })
```

### Editor (EntryBodyEditor.svelte)

```ts
// BEFORE
const contentDoc = fuji.bodies.body('entries', entryId);
$effect(() => () => contentDoc[Symbol.dispose]());
// ySyncPlugin(contentDoc.binding); await contentDoc.idb.whenLoaded;

// AFTER (still never imports the table; the touch lives in the builder, not here)
const body = fuji.entryBodies.open(entryId);
$effect(() => () => body[Symbol.dispose]());
// ySyncPlugin(body.binding); await body.whenLoaded;
```

### Markdown export (apps/fuji/.../markdown.ts)

```ts
// BEFORE: const contentDoc = host.bodies.body('entries', entry.id); await contentDoc.idb.whenLoaded; contentDoc.read()
// AFTER
using body = host.entryBodies.open(entry.id);
await body.whenLoaded;
const text = body.read();
```

### Daemon (apps/fuji/.../project.ts): no cache, read bodies inline per row

The daemon does not pre-load bodies into a map and does not run a startup loop. The
markdown materializer's `toMarkdown(row)` hook reads the body inline, per row, every time
the row materializes:

```ts
const readEntryBody = async (entry) => {
  const ydoc = new Y.Doc({ guid: entryContentDocGuid(entry.id), gc: true });
  const collaboration = openCollaboration(ydoc, {
    url: roomWsUrl({ baseURL, ownerId, guid: ydoc.guid, deviceId }),
    openWebSocket, onReconnectSignal, actions: {},               // a content doc: no actions
  });
  try {
    await withTimeout(collaboration.whenConnected, BODY_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS, label); // NOT firstSync
    return attachRichText(ydoc).read();                          // STEP2 applied -> real content
  } finally {
    ydoc.destroy();                                              // cascade-disposes the socket
    await collaboration.whenDisposed;
  }
};

attachMarkdownMaterializer(workspace, {
  perTable: { entries: {
    filename: slugFilename('title'),
    toMarkdown: async (entry) => ({ frontmatter: { ...entry }, body: await readEntryBody(entry) }),
  } },
});
```

Two corrections to the earlier sketch, found when it met the real code:

- `openCollaboration` (sync only), NOT `attachProjectSync` (sync + yjs-log). A
  body read is a read. The daemon already writes the body to disk as the `.md` file, so a
  per-body yjs-log is a redundant second on-disk copy. Persistence buys only delta sync
  over full sync (marginal for KB notes) and does NOT remove the connect wait: the daemon
  must still sync to fetch edits made since the last read.

- Inline reactive, NOT a startup loop. Reading inside `toMarkdown` means the materializer
  re-reads a body whenever its row changes; the browser's `updatedAt` touch fires on every
  body edit, so a body edit propagates to the `.md` for free. This is the steady-state body
  reactivity the 180000 spec scoped as Phase 3; it falls out of the materializer, so it is
  no longer separate work. The first implementation's snapshot-map + deferred-promise
  barrier shipped a real defect: a later body edit bumped `updatedAt`, the materializer
  rewrote the `.md` with a fresh timestamp but the frozen startup body. Inline reads fix it
  and delete the coordination glue.

Known cost (tracked, not fixed here): on a cold restart, loading the root log fires the
observer for every entry, so every body is re-read once. The proper fix is a materializer
"skip when the row's `updatedAt` matches the on-disk frontmatter" dirty-check, not body
persistence. `withTimeout` bounds a single wedged room; its cleaner home is a
connect-deadline option on `openCollaboration`.

> SUPERSEDED by the 2026-05-31 addendum: the `dirtyKey` skip described here was built and
> then reverted. The cold-restart re-read is now the accepted cost AND the heal mechanism.
> Only the `connectDeadlineMs` half of this paragraph survived.

## Design decisions

### D1. An app-owned, typed cache keyed by the app's id (NOT a generic guid opener)

```txt
Decision:
  Each app builds its own createDisposableCache keyed by its row id type (EntryId for
  fuji). The build closure derives the guid, attaches the shared type, wires side effects.
  No generic docs.open(guid). No library createDocs wrapper.

Why:
  - Typed in, typed out: entryBodies.open(entryId) -> a fuji body handle. A raw
    docs.open(guid) is stringly-typed, has no row link, and invites opening arbitrary
    docs with no known type, the column.doc() footgun 180000 decision C refused.
  - createDisposableCache already IS the substrate (open/refcount/grace/dispose). A
    createDocs(open) wrapper saved ~5 lines and added a generic layer for no capability.
  - It is the convergent prior art at the right altitude (repo.find/LocalNode.load cache
    by id), specialized to a typed id with a derived guid.

Refused:
  - A library createDocs(open) primitive. Mentally inlined, it is createDisposableCache
    plus the ydoc-nesting boilerplate; the boilerplate is 3 lines and reads fine inline.
  - A generic top-level docs.open(guid). Untyped, link-less, footgun. If a second doc
    KIND appears (attachments), make a SECOND typed cache, honestly separate.
```

### D2. Derive the guid; do NOT store a url column (escape hatch named)

```txt
Decision:
  The row->doc link is entryContentDocGuid(id) = docGuid(FUJI_ID,'entries',id,'content'),
  unchanged from today. Nothing is stored on the row. No body column of any kind.

Why:
  - Total function: every row has an openable guid with no write step, so no "bodyless
    row" failure mode (the bug a stored id introduces if a create site forgets it).
  - Parity: entryContentDocGuid is byte-identical to today's storage; existing bodies are
    found at their current rooms with NO data move.
  - For fuji, content belongs to exactly one entry forever; the row id is an immutable
    nanoid, so the derived guid is as stable as the row. Nothing to decouple.

Refused (named as the escape hatch):
  - Storing a url/id column (the automerge-repo / Jazz reference model). Right ONLY when a
    doc must be decoupled from its row (re-parented, shared, kept after hard-delete). No
    app needs this today. Reversible: the cache key and builder change, nothing else.
```

### D3. Use the existing createDisposableCache directly (ship no new primitive)

```txt
Decision:
  The body cache is a direct createDisposableCache call in the app's browser composition.
  No createDocs, no online(), no attachBodyCache.

Why:
  - The whole point of the inversion is that the framework owes nothing new. Every layer
    added (createDocs/online/attachBodyCache) is mentally-inlinable into a
    createDisposableCache call with an app-specific build closure.
  - The build closure (derive guid, wire storage+sync, attach rich text, wire touch,
    compose dispose) is ~12 lines of honest app composition that reads top to bottom. It
    is the buildEntryContentDoc the collapse spec (20260420) already designed and liked.

Refused:
  - A shared `online`/`wire` LIBRARY helper. A LOCAL wire(ydoc, actions) inside browser.ts
    (so root + body do not copy-paste the attachLocalStorage+openCollaboration pair) is
    optional and fine, but it is a 5-line local DRY helper, not a library concept or a
    named lifecycle. Do not export it.
```

### D4. The cache is BROWSER-ONLY; the daemon does not track

```txt
Decision:
  createDisposableCache lives in openFujiBrowser (needs signedIn). The daemon does NOT use
  it: it loops, building one Y.Doc at a time, reading, destroying.

Why:
  - The cache exists for idempotency under CONCURRENT surfaces (editor + export/preview),
    which only the browser has. The daemon processes one guid at a time, so a cache would
    only ever hold one entry; it is pure overhead there.
  - Two honest lifecycles (180000 decision G): browser holds bodies live while the UI
    references them; the daemon must NOT hold every body live (a large vault would exhaust
    memory). The asymmetry is expressed by browser-has-a-cache / daemon-loops, not a flag.
```

### D5. The touch lives in the build closure, not the editor and not the library

```txt
Decision:
  onLocalUpdate(ydoc, () => tables.entries.update(id, { updatedAt: now() })) lives in the
  build closure (which closes over tables). The editor calls open() and never references
  the table. The daemon's loop simply never wires it (it must not write rows).

Why:
  - onLocalUpdate's tx.local filter already prevents IDB hydration / remote sync from
    bumping; only a real local edit does.
  - Keeping it in the builder (not the editor) keeps the editor decoupled from the schema
    (180000 decision D) AND keeps it out of the library (there is no library). The
    browser/daemon asymmetry is which composition wires it.
```

### D6. The handle shape

```txt
Decision:
  open(id) returns { ydoc, binding, read, whenLoaded, [Symbol.dispose] }. `binding` for
  ySyncPlugin, `read` for export/materialize, `whenLoaded` to gate UI, `ydoc` as the
  escape hatch, dispose decrements the refcount (createDisposableCache grace handles
  teardown).

Why:
  - Exactly what the three consumers need (editor, export, daemon-read), nothing more.
  - ydoc is exposed but documented as the escape hatch; routine code uses binding/read.
```

### D7. Pass attachRichText directly; delete the richText() codec wrapper

```txt
Decision:
  The build closure calls attachRichText(ydoc) directly. BodyCodec + richText() deleted.

Why:
  - attachRichText(ydoc) -> { binding, read } is already the primitive. The codec was a
    single-method object around it; "codec" was the wrong word (it binds a shared type and
    reads it, it does not encode/decode bytes). With the builder owning the type, nothing
    is left to wrap.

Refused:
  - A content-type factory survives ONLY when a type takes OPTIONS (attachTimeline(...),
    attachRichText({ placeholder })). Even then the builder calls it directly; no universal
    codec type.
```

---

## Parity invariant (prove first; the only data-safety item)

```txt
entryContentDocGuid(id) is UNCHANGED, so every existing body is found at its current room.
Cheapest decisive check (no cloud, no fs):
  assert entryContentDocGuid(someId) === docGuid({workspaceId:FUJI_ID, collection:'entries',
                                                  rowId:someId, field:'content'})
This is already true (it IS that call). Deleting column.body changes ZERO stored bytes
because column.body was always partitioned out of the stored row. No migration, no move.
```

---

## Encryption gradation (carried over from 220260530T220000 Part 2, UNCHANGED)

This spec changes the doc-opener mechanism only. The encryption posture still governs:

```txt
- The keyring is SERVER-derived (ENCRYPTION_SECRETS + ownerId, re-fetched at /api/session),
  NOT user-held. So there is NO consumer key-loss risk, and it is NOT zero-knowledge (the
  operator can re-derive the key).
- Decision: stay Path A (host-trusted encryption at rest, recoverable, full-featured).
  Self-host is the privacy answer (same third-party privacy as zero-knowledge, fails
  gracefully). Bodies stay encrypted at rest (per-guid IDB). Do NOT build wire-sealing now
  (with a server-derived key it would not hide bodies from the operator, only a passive
  relay leak). Keep zero-knowledge POSSIBLE; do not build it.
- Body docs opened by the cache thread the keyring EXACTLY as the root does
  (attachLocalStorage derives the per-guid at-rest key off ydoc.guid). The cache is
  agnostic to this: the build closure just calls attachLocalStorage, which already threads
  the keyring.
```

---

## What we lose / what we gain

```txt
LOSE
- No compile-time "this field is a body" hint; it becomes a convention (entryContentDocGuid
  + the entryBodies cache, both next to the table, named + documented: one hop to find).
- The daemon is not generic across apps; each app wires ~12 lines of materialization.
- The 3 small per-app guid functions 180000 wanted to delete stay (3 lines each), local
  and honest, far cheaper than the subsystem that replaced them.

GAIN
- 5 files + 3 tests deleted, ~500+ LOC removed; ZERO new library primitives.
- Tables return to plain Record<string,TSchema>: no ColumnLike, DataColumns, partition,
  pending-map hack.
- The one place a body lives is one ~15-line closure you can point at.
- Adding a second doc kind (attachments) is another typed cache, not a generic bag.
```

---

## Phased plan (build, prove, remove)

```txt
Phase 1  Fuji browser: add the entryBodies = createDisposableCache(...) closure (+ optional
         local wire helper); expose `entryBodies` on the bundle. Repoint EntryBodyEditor +
         markdown to fuji.entryBodies.open(id). Delete the attachBodyCache usage.
         Prove: editor binds, edits persist + sync, updatedAt bumps, route-swap reuses.
         (column.body still present but unused at this point.)

Phase 2  Fuji daemon: the ~12-line materialize loop (no cache). Delete the sweep-bodies
         usage. Prove: daemon writes the entry .md body.

Phase 3  Stop importing the body subsystem everywhere (now unused on disk). Typecheck +
         tests green. This is the rollback point.

Phase 4  DELETE: column/body.ts, body-codec.ts, body-doc-set.ts, attach-body-cache.ts,
         daemon/sweep-bodies.ts + their tests. SHRINK table.ts/define-table.ts/sugar.ts
         back to plain columns. Remove the deleted barrel exports. Delete the
         `content: column.body(...)` schema line. Grep zero: column.body, attachBodyCache,
         BodyMarker, bodyDocGuids, richText(, BodyCodec, partitionColumns, ColumnLike.

Phase 5  Verify: bun test (workspace + fuji), bun run build, bun run typecheck (fuji).
         Manual smoke: create entry, type body, reload (persist), two tabs (sync), daemon
         up (.md has body). Parity assert from above.
```

## Risks

```txt
- Blast radius is the schema layer (table.ts/define-table.ts partition removal). Do it LAST
  (Phase 4), after the new path is proven, so a revert point exists.
- createDisposableCache requires the cached value be a plain object (it spreads to build the
  handle), NOT a bare Y.Doc. The build closure returns { ydoc, ... }; never return the raw
  Y.Doc.
- Daemon connect wait: use collaboration.whenConnected, NOT a non-existent firstSync (the
  yjs-log has no whenLoaded). Add a per-doc connect timeout so one stalled room cannot back
  up the loop.
- Body confidentiality is unchanged (plaintext to the relay + daemon log today). See the
  encryption gradation; decide consciously, do not discover.
- Multi-body-per-table / multi-table bodies: add another typed cache + guid helper. No
  library change; that is the point.
```

## Review

**Completed**: 2026-05-31
**Branch**: body-docs-app-owned-cache

### What Landed

Fuji now owns entry body construction in `openFujiBrowser()`. The browser exposes
`fuji.entryBodies.open(entryId)`, and the builder derives the existing
`entryContentDocGuid(id)`, attaches rich text, wires local storage and sync, and bumps
`updatedAt` on local body edits.

The daemon path no longer uses the deleted sweep helper. The markdown materializer's
`toMarkdown(row)` hook reads each entry body inline: open a throwaway doc at
`entryContentDocGuid(id)`, `openCollaboration` (sync only, `actions: {}`), wait on
`collaboration.whenConnected` with a `withTimeout` bound, read `attachRichText(ydoc).read()`,
destroy. No snapshot map, no startup loop, no per-body persistence.

### Deviations and Discoveries

- The spec's `markdown.writeBody(...)` pseudocode was not a real API. Fuji writes body
  text through the existing markdown materializer shape: `toMarkdown(row)` returns
  `{ frontmatter, body }`.
- The first implementation pre-loaded bodies into a map gated by a deferred promise; it
  rewrote stale bodies on any `updatedAt` change. Replaced with an inline reactive read in
  `toMarkdown`, which self-heals on every edit and deletes the coordination glue.
- `openCollaboration` replaced `attachProjectSync` for body reads: a read needs
  sync, not a second on-disk yjs-log (the `.md` is already the daemon's body copy).
- The deleted subsystem files were already untracked in the worktree when implementation
  started. They were removed from disk, but they do not appear as tracked deletions in
  `git diff --stat`.

### Verification

- `bun run --filter @epicenter/workspace typecheck`
- `bun run --filter @epicenter/fuji typecheck`
- `bun run --filter @epicenter/workspace test`
- `bun run --filter @epicenter/fuji test`
- `bun run --filter @epicenter/fuji build`
- Required grep-zero sweep across `apps` and `packages`
- Parity assertion: `entryContentDocGuid(id) === docGuid({ workspaceId: FUJI_ID, collection: 'entries', rowId: id, field: 'content' })`

Root `bun run build` was also run and failed in unrelated `opensidian#build` code at
`apps/opensidian/src/lib/state/skill-state.svelte.ts:145`.

## Addendum (2026-05-31): dirtyKey reversed; restart-as-heal is the contract

The first pass after this spec added a materializer `dirtyKey` to fix the cold-start
re-read storm noted above ("The proper fix is a materializer skip-when... dirty-check").
On a second look that was the wrong call, and it has been **reverted** (commit dropping
the `dirtyKey` config field, `seedDirtyKeys`, the skip checks, fuji's
`dirtyKey: (e) => e.updatedAt`, and the two tests).

Why it was wrong:

```txt
dirtyKey bought ONE thing: skip the cold-start body re-read storm on daemon restart.
  - Steady state already only fires the observer for changed rows.
  - A metadata edit bumps updatedAt anyway, so dirtyKey did NOT save that re-read.
  - Its sole value was "don't re-sync every body when the daemon restarts."

It paid for that with:
  1. A RACY cross-doc proxy. updatedAt lives in the ROOT doc; the body lives in
     ANOTHER doc syncing over a SEPARATE socket. "edit body, close tab fast" can
     flush the root updatedAt before the body update flushes. The daemon then reads
     a STALE body, writes .md (stale body + new timestamp), and records the key.
     onLocalUpdate fires only on tx.local, so the reconnect flush of the body update
     never re-bumps updatedAt -> the .md stays stale until the next MANUAL edit.
  2. A cross-file invariant (materialization depends on the browser's onLocalUpdate
     touch firing on every body edit).
  3. A YAML round-trip fragility (the cold-start seed parsed updatedAt back out of
     on-disk frontmatter; a parser that coerced it to a Date would silently disable
     the gate).
  4. THE BIG ONE: it killed restart-as-heal. WITHOUT dirtyKey, every daemon restart
     re-reads every body fresh, which self-HEALS any .md left stale by #1. WITH
     dirtyKey, the staleness was permanent across restarts.
```

The reframe: `dirtyKey` is a workaround for `toMarkdown` having a HIDDEN SIDE-INPUT
(the body doc) the materializer cannot see. The honest generic "skip when unchanged"
is "hash the row-DERIVED output" (automatic, no user key), which is valid only when
`toMarkdown` is PURE in the row. Fuji's body read is exactly what does NOT fit that
contract, which is the tell.

New contract (simpler, more correct at fuji's scale):

```txt
The daemon .md is a DERIVED PROJECTION, not the source of truth (the body Y.Doc is).
The daemon re-reads every body on every restart. That is the cost we accept, and it
is also the feature: a restart heals any stale projection left by a cross-doc race.
At fuji's scale (tens to low-hundreds of entries) the restart re-read is trivial.
```

What still holds from the body of this spec: app-owned typed caches (D1), no new
library primitive (D3), browser caches / daemon loops (D4), the derived guid (D2), the
encryption gradation. `connectDeadlineMs` is KEPT: with inline sequential reads, one
wedged room must not hang the loop, so the per-read deadline is genuinely needed.

When scale arrives (a thousand-entry vault), the fix is NOT a better proxy key. It is a
bounded-LRU daemon that holds body docs live and materializes each from the BODY doc's
OWN observer (no proxy, no race, no dirtyKey). That needs LRU on `createDisposableCache`
and a conscious revisit of D4's "never hold bodies live." Deliberately deferred.
