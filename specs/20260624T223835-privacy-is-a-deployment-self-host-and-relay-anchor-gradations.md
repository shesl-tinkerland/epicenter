# Privacy is a deployment: the star you run, the services you call, and the self-host configurations

- **Status:** Draft
- **Date:** 2026-06-24
- **Branch:** wash-saddle
- **Records (durable decisions, the authoritative homes):**
  - [ADR-0068](../docs/adr/0068-privacy-is-a-deployment-not-a-product-feature.md): privacy is a deployment, not a product feature; the hosted app carries zero privacy-configuration surface.
  - [ADR-0069](../docs/adr/0069-epicenter-is-one-runnable-star-plus-services-called-by-url-and-token.md): Epicenter is one runnable program (the star) plus a la carte services addressed by `{baseUrl, token?}`.
  - [ADR-0070](../docs/adr/0070-self-host-adds-no-new-ownership-or-auth-mode.md): self-host adds no new ownership or auth mode; single-user is a preset, only the credential source varies.
- **Builds on:** [ADR-0004](../docs/adr/0004-trust-the-relay-reject-zero-knowledge.md) (trust the relay; privacy is topology), [ADR-0035](../docs/adr/0035-durable-storage-is-one-per-person-coordination-box.md) (the star roles), [ADR-0066](../docs/adr/0066-runtime-portability-is-per-concern-injection-not-a-runtime-object.md) (the Bun star binary), and the article [`docs/articles/20260615T140000-dont-encrypt-the-data-dont-hold-it.md`](../docs/articles/20260615T140000-dont-encrypt-the-data-dont-hold-it.md).

## One sentence

```
Epicenter is a program you run plus services you call. Self-host runs the
program; either deployment calls the services; privacy is only about who runs
the program. There is no privacy ladder, only that one custody fork and an
orthogonal, already-config-driven service menu.
```

## What this spec is

The durable decisions now live in ADR-0068/0069/0070 (above); the vocabulary (relay, anchor, store, worker) lives in [`docs/CONTEXT.md`](../docs/CONTEXT.md); the user-facing trust copy lives in [`docs/trust-model.md`](../docs/trust-model.md). If this spec disagrees with an ADR, the ADR wins.

What stays here is the **in-flight map**: the model as a picture, the self-host configurations with their ASCII and honest pros/cons (today and after Iroh), the ledger of what self-host does and does not protect, and the work waves. When the waves land, this spec is deleted; the ADRs persist.

## The model in one picture

```
        THE STAR  - the program you run, the ONE custody fork
   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐    run by:
   │ anchor (Y.Doc) · store (S3) · sync · identity │    • Epicenter = "hosted"
   └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘    • you        = "self-host"
      ▲                │ calls out (optional · {baseUrl, token?} · point anywhere)
      │ your devices   ▼
   ┌──┴──────┐   SERVICES YOU CALL
   │ phone   │   ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ laptop  │   │ inference  → Epicenter gateway / your Ollama  │ stateless
   │ browser │   │ blob URLs  → `epicenter blobs add` (a star)   │ owner-scoped
   └─────────┘   │            → OR the star's own S3 endpoint    │
                 └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   Privacy = who runs the STAR. A service only ever sees the one payload you
   hand it (a prompt, a blob). Moving a service endpoint is not moving custody.
```

The collapse this records: the earlier "privacy rung ladder" (hosted / own-anchor-blind-relay / full self-host) was false. Its "middle rung" was a service-endpoint swap mis-modeled as a custody change. There is one custody fork (the star) and a menu of callable services, nothing in between.

## The two axes inside the star (and why "sovereign" is not a third mode)

Running the star composes from two orthogonal seams that already exist in `packages/server`. Self-host needs no new mode; it picks values on these axes (ADR-0070).

```
  AXIS 1 · PARTITION  (OwnershipRule)        "whose data is it"
     personal  → owners/<userId>/            per-user partition
     shared    → owners/shared/  + admit()   one co-owned partition, allowlisted
        └─ exactly two. complete. a key is derived-per-identity OR pinned-to-a
           -constant; there is no third shape.

  AXIS 2 · AUTH  (resolveUser)               "how a request becomes an identity"
     OAuth │ local bearer token │ reverse-proxy header │ fixed-owner (dev only)
        └─ one TOTAL gate (every route resolves a user; no no-auth fork).
           only the CREDENTIAL SOURCE varies per deployment.

  "single-user / sovereign self-host" = a PRESET over these two
        ( shared(admit:always) OR personal-with-one-account )
        + ( resolveUser = local bearer token )
     NOT a new OwnershipRule.kind. single-owner is an emergent count, a
     consequence of admitting one identity, never a topology.
```

The decisive probe: `personal` with one user yields one partition; `shared` with one user yields one partition. Both already collapse to single-owner, so "sovereign" has no distinct partition behavior to add. It is a named preset at most, never a third kind.

## The configurations today (relay and anchor fused; the choice is binary)

```
  A · SOLO HOMELAB, always-on box                  flagship (after 2 fixes)
  ┌─────────┐         your box · one Bun binary
  │ laptop  │       ┌────────────────────────────────┐

   + your data never leaves the box   - needs the 2 gaps (* token source, client URL)
   + truest local-first               - you babysit Postgres + S3 + uptime

  B · SOLO, no always-on box                        does NOT work as self-host
  ┌─────────┐
  │ laptop  │   there is no durable holder. a sleeping laptop + a phone cannot
  │ phone   │   host the anchor. honest answer: use HOSTED (still private if you
  └─────────┘   trust the operator). this is a feature of "privacy is topology",
                not a gap to apologize for.

  C · FAMILY / TEAM, each owns their data           flagship (after 2 fixes)
  ┌─────────┐       your box · one Bun binary
  │ members │══════▶│ star, partition: personal (owners/<each-userId>/)        │
  └─────────┘       │ auth: reverse-proxy header in front of your own IdP      │
   + clean per-member isolation on one machine   - everyone needs an identity
   + one box to maintain                          - you are the ops team of one

  D · FAMILY / TEAM, shared wiki                    supported NOW (only built one)
  ┌─────────┐       Cloudflare Worker (apps/self-host)

  └─────────┘       │ auth: OAuth + admit predicate                            │
   + the one config with a real deployable + tests  - it is a CF WORKER (needs a
   + co-ownership matches a wiki's model              CF account, not your metal)

  E · SELF-HOST the star, RENT Epicenter services   useful, but a footgun
  ┌─────────┐  your box (star, docs local)    Epicenter (services)
  │ devices │═▶│ anchor + sync (yours)  │──{baseUrl,token}──▶ inference / blobs
  └─────────┘  └────────────────────────┘
   + offload GPU/models, keep the Y.Doc local   - RENTED BLOBS land in Epicenter's
   + inference sees only the prompt you send       R2, readable by Epicenter (your
                                                   media leaves the box). keep media
                                                   private => point the store at YOUR S3.

  F · AIR-GAPPED / SOVEREIGN                        advanced (after non-OAuth auth)
  ┌─────────┐  your box, zero Epicenter contact
  │ devices │═▶│ star + own Ollama (inference) + own S3 (store)                │
  └─────────┘  └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   + maximal sovereignty, no Epicenter bearer ever leaves   - blocked TODAY: the
   + inference (custom baseUrl) + S3 already supported         only built login is
                                                              Google OAuth (* the gap)
```

There is intentionally **no "partial self-host" config** distinct from the above. "Own your data but use Epicenter's relay" is not a row, because today the relay and anchor are fused in one Durable Object (ADR-0035), so it would still hand Epicenter your plaintext. It becomes honest only after Iroh.

## The same configurations after Iroh (the relay splits off, blind)

Iroh seals device-to-device transit (QUIC) and turns the relay into a blind forwarder of frames it cannot read. The custody question does not change (the anchor still decrypts and stores), so this is **better plumbing on the same configs**, plus one genuinely new option (G).

```
  A/C/F upgraded · sealed transit, same custody
  ┌─────────┐  Iroh sealed QUIC   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────┐
  │ devices │═══════════════════▶ │ relay (blind) │─▶ │ your star (anchor...) │
  └─────────┘                     └──────────────┘   └──────────────────────┘
   the wire got sealed; the anchor did not move. still you-run. still private.

  HOSTED upgraded · sealed transit to Epicenter's anchor   (Leo: laptop+phone)
  ┌─────────┐  Iroh sealed QUIC   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────┐
  │ devices │═══════════════════▶ │ relay (blind) │─▶ │ Epicenter star (reads)│
  └─────────┘                     └──────────────┘   └──────────────────────┘
   sealed wire, but Epicenter is still the anchor and reads at rest. NOT a new
   privacy rung: it is hosted (config B's answer) with better transport.

  G · NEW · own a lightweight anchor, borrow Epicenter's BLIND relay
  ┌─────────┐  Iroh   ┌──────────────┐  Iroh   ┌────────────────────┐
  │ phone   │═sealed═▶│ relay (blind) │═sealed═▶│ your anchor + store │ only YOU
  │ laptop  │  QUIC   │ Epicenter-run │  QUIC   │ (your data at rest) │ read it
  └─────────┘         │ + maybe login │         └────────────────────┘
                      └──────────────┘
   own your data WITHOUT standing up a public ingress: no port-forwarding, no
   OAuth issuer to run. honest ONLY because the relay is now genuinely blind.
   this is config A/C with the "reachability" burden handed to a blind helper.
```

So Iroh's one genuinely new configuration is **G**: own the anchor, rent only blind reachability. Everything else is an existing config with sealed transit.

## Encryption overlays (they ride on any configuration)

Epicenter encrypts no content today (not docs, not blobs); see [`docs/trust-model.md`](../docs/trust-model.md). Two narrow encryption returns are deferred, and both reuse one envelope, not three subsystems:

- **Secret confidentiality.** Default is "do not hold it": keep a secret device-local (OS keychain) and store only a reference in the doc, resolved at use. The **vault** (an explicitly encrypted, shared workspace, Argon2-derived key) is only for the residual case of a secret that must *both* sync *and* stay blind. Most secrets, including BYOK API keys (ADR-0054), never touch it.
- **Backup recovery.** Only earns its keep for a self-hosted star backing up to untrusted storage (the hosted user already trusts the operator with the live doc, so an encrypted backup buys them nothing). Minimal build: ship a snapshot `export`; let the user seal it with their own tool. A built-in `seal()` is a later convenience reusing the vault's one envelope.

## The honest ledger: is self-host "private enough"?

**Genuinely private today (confirmed against the code):**

- Epicenter never holds or sees self-hosted workspace data. The blob store is a portable S3 client (`s3-blob-store.ts`), so bytes live in your bucket, not R2.
- Auth is local to the deployment: your own Better Auth, Postgres, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, OAuth client. No callback through Epicenter.
- No vendor-CDN remote code execution; the server emits no telemetry, billing, or update beacons.

**The honest caveats:**

1. **Gating gap: prebuilt clients cannot point at a self-host origin without a rebuild.** Node/CLI honor `EPICENTER_API_URL`; the browser apps bake `https://api.epicenter.so` and the OAuth client id at build time (`packages/constants/src/apps.ts`). Privacy-via-topology is meaningless if the client cannot choose the topology. **The most important fix.**
2. **The shipped self-host artifact is a Cloudflare Worker** (`apps/self-host`), which needs a Cloudflare account plus Hyperdrive. The "one Bun binary plus Postgres plus any S3" path exists (`apps/api/server.ts`) but is not packaged as the self-host artifact, has no migration docs, and ships no compiled binary.
3. **Login depends on Google OAuth** (email/password disabled in `base-config.ts`), so a self-hoster must register a Google app to log into their own box. ADR-0070's local credential source removes this.
4. **The relay sees metadata** (user id, node id, per-room co-presence, dispatched action names, timing, sizes, client IP). Yours when you run it; a who-talks-to-whom graph when you use Epicenter's. Even the future blind relay sees this; it only stops seeing content. Document, do not paper over.

So: self-host gives real **content** confidentiality against Epicenter today; the **reachability** of your own instance is the unfinished half (caveats 1 and 2), and the **no-cloud-login** half is caveat 3.

## Storage: versitygw for local/dev, Garage for self-host (not MinIO)

The blob store is endpoint-agnostic (`BLOBS_S3_ENDPOINT` is config), so any S3-compatible store works. We standardize on **versitygw** (`apps/api/compose.yaml`, an S3 API over a plain folder) for dev and the smallest self-host, and **Garage** (single-binary, S3-compatible) as the self-host default when you want a real object store. **MinIO is retired** from our docs and examples. The blob code never changes; the endpoint is configuration.

## The work (waves)

The work is making the deployment choice real and removing the self-host friction, which is concentrated in two seam-ready gaps plus one honest constraint. None of waves 1 to 3 need Iroh.

| Wave | Scope | Makes true |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Package the Bun star binary.** Built on `apps/api/server.ts`, a `compose.yaml` bundling Postgres + Garage/versitygw + the binary, a documented migration step, a `bun build --compile` artifact. | configs A/C/F: "a homelabber runs it in an afternoon" |
| 2 | **Client instance-URL setting** (browser + desktop), so a self-hosted origin is reachable from prebuilt apps without a rebuild, OAuth issuer/audience included. | caveat 1; privacy-via-topology actually deliverable |
| 3 | **Local credential source for self-host** (ADR-0070): a single-user bearer token printed at first boot as the default; reverse-proxy header and opt-in email/password as escape hatches; the fixed-owner resolver stays quarantined to dev. Optionally a `sovereign()`/preset factory beside `personal()`/`shared()` if ergonomics warrant. | caveat 3: no Google app to reach your own box |
| 4 | **Document the trust model honestly:** relay metadata, the IdP dependency, the rented-blob-locality footgun (config E), the "we can read your data on hosted, not self-host" line. | the honesty bar |
| 5 (later) | **The Iroh relay/anchor split:** a blind relay separated from the anchor, unlocking configuration G (own anchor + blind relay) and sealed transit on every config. | config G; sealed transit |
| 6 (later) | **The one encryption envelope:** the vault for must-sync-and-stay-blind secrets, and a turnkey `seal()` for backup, both reusing one primitive. | secret confidentiality + backup recovery |

## Non-goals and deferred

- **Privacy tiers / custody / seal as product features.** Rejected (ADR-0068). The hosted app has zero privacy surface.
- **A third "sovereign" ownership mode.** Rejected (ADR-0070). Single-user is a preset over `personal`/`shared` plus a local credential source.
- **A no-auth code path.** Rejected as a mode (ADR-0070). The same effect is the quarantined fixed-owner `resolveUser` provider behind a localhost guard.
- **A "partial self-host" privacy rung before Iroh.** Refused: false privacy claim while the relay and anchor are fused. Becomes configuration G after wave 5.
- **An encrypted hosted mode for the boxless-privacy user.** Deferred, additive-later per ADR-0004. Trigger: that user becomes a real, asked-for segment.

## ADRs recorded

[ADR-0068](../docs/adr/0068-privacy-is-a-deployment-not-a-product-feature.md), [ADR-0069](../docs/adr/0069-epicenter-is-one-runnable-star-plus-services-called-by-url-and-token.md), and [ADR-0070](../docs/adr/0070-self-host-adds-no-new-ownership-or-auth-mode.md), all Accepted 2026-06-24. The decisions are locked even though waves 1 to 3 are in flight, because the refusals (no privacy surface, no extra modes, no no-auth fork) are in force now; the waves are their consequences.

Wave 2's client instance setting landed as [ADR-0071](../docs/adr/0071-oauth-is-hosted-only-a-custom-instance-requires-a-token.md) (OAuth is hosted-only), and wave 3's server credential as [ADR-0072](../docs/adr/0072-the-self-host-star-mints-and-persists-its-own-first-boot-bearer.md), which pins the first-boot-bearer default ADR-0070 left to this spec. Wave 3 also settled the open framing the row above left unstated: a self-host box does not carry a mode flag and does not gate solo-vs-shared on the optional `sovereign()` factory; it recomputes its shape from the configured OAuth provider set (none configured is the solo bearer box, any configured is the shared wiki), so the gate can never disagree with what accepts a sign-in.
