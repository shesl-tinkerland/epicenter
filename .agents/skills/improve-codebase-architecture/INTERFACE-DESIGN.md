# Interface Design

When the user wants to explore alternative interfaces for a chosen deepening candidate, use this parallel design pattern. Based on "Design It Twice" (Ousterhout): your first idea is unlikely to be the best.

Uses the vocabulary in [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md): **module**, **interface**, **seam**, **adapter**, **leverage**.

## Process

### 1. Frame the problem space

Before creating interface sketches, write a user-facing explanation of the problem space for the chosen candidate:

- The constraints any new interface would need to satisfy
- The dependencies it would rely on, and which category they fall into (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
- A rough illustrative code sketch to ground the constraints, not a proposal, just a way to make the constraints concrete

Show this to the user, then immediately proceed to Step 2. The user reads and thinks while the interface sketches run in parallel, if delegation is available.

### 2. Create interface sketches

Produce 3+ **radically different** interfaces for the deepened module. If the runtime permits bounded subagents and parallelism adds value, delegate each sketch to a separate read-only agent. Otherwise, draft the sketches locally as separate passes.

Give each sketch a separate technical brief (file paths, coupling details, dependency category from [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md), what sits behind the seam). The brief is independent of the user-facing problem-space explanation in Step 1. Give each sketch a different design constraint:

- Sketch 1: "Minimize the interface: aim for 1-3 entry points max. Maximise leverage per entry point."
- Sketch 2: "Maximise flexibility: support many use cases and extension."
- Sketch 3: "Optimise for the most common caller: make the default case trivial."
- Sketch 4 (if applicable): "Design around ports & adapters for cross-seam dependencies."

Include both [LANGUAGE.md](LANGUAGE.md) vocabulary and CONTEXT.md vocabulary in the brief so each sketch names things consistently with the architecture language and the project's domain language.

Each sketch outputs:

1. Interface (types, methods, params, plus invariants, ordering, error modes)
2. Usage example showing how callers use it
3. What the implementation hides behind the seam
4. Dependency strategy and adapters (see [DEEPENING.md](DEEPENING.md))
5. Trade-offs: where leverage is high, where it's thin

### 3. Present and compare

Present designs sequentially so the user can absorb each one, then compare them in prose. Contrast by **depth** (leverage at the interface), **locality** (where change concentrates), and **seam placement**.

After comparing, give your own recommendation: which design you think is strongest and why. Pick the one design you would want to own and maintain long term. Be opinionated: the user wants a strong read, not a menu.
