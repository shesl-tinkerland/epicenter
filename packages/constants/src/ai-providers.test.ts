/**
 * Provider label resolution contract.
 *
 * Pins the one behavior the type system cannot: an id this deploy does not
 * recognize falls back to the raw string rather than throwing. The activity
 * feed reads arbitrary historical provider ids off persisted billing events, so
 * one unrecognized id must degrade to a single literal cell instead of failing
 * the whole read. "Every live provider has a label" is left to the
 * `AI_PROVIDERS satisfies Record<AiProvider>` compile guard, not duplicated here.
