 * The hosted origin never changes per deploy, so it lives here in TypeScript
 * rather than being duplicated into apps/api's wrangler.jsonc vars.
 *
 * The dashboard SPA is served at `api.epicenter.so/dashboard` (same origin as
 * the API) so it does not get its own APPS entry; its dev port lives inline in
