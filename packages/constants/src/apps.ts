/**
 * Single source of truth for all Epicenter app URLs and ports.
 *
 * Each app declares its dev port and production URLs. The first URL in
 * `urls` is the canonical production URL (used by Vite prod builds).
 * All URLs are included in CORS and trusted origins.
 *
 * To add an app: add an entry here. TypeScript enforces that every
 * consumer picks it up automatically.
