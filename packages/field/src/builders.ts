/**
 * The `field.*` authoring builders: the CONSTRUCTION half of the closed field
 * vocabulary. `recognize` (in `./field`) is the recognition half. They are
 * inverses over ONE wire-form: serialize a `field.X(...)` schema to its at-rest
 * JSON and `recognize` classifies it back to kind `X`. `field.test.ts` proves
 * the round-trip for every kind.
 *
 * Every builder is a thin composition of native TypeBox constructors that emit
 * the recognized wire-form directly:
 *
 *   field.select(['a','b'])      Type.Enum            -> {enum:['a','b']}        Static = 'a' | 'b'
 *   field.multiSelect(['a','b']) Type.Array(Type.Enum)-> {type:'array',items:{enum:[...]}}
 *   field.tags()                 Type.Array(Type.String) -> {type:'array',items:{type:'string'}}
 *   field.number/integer/boolean Type.Number/Integer/Boolean (full TypeBox JSDoc preserved)
 *
 * `Type.Enum` is the load-bearing choice: in TypeBox v1 it emits the native JSON
 * Schema `enum` keyword, infers `Static` as the literal union, and carries `enum`
 * at the type level, so authoring, recognition, and the SQLite mirror all read
 * one shape with no `Type.Unsafe` and no value-to-tuple gymnastics.
 *
 * Branding still rides on `Type.Unsafe` for the cases that need a brand the
 * wire-form cannot express: `field.string<Brand>()`, `field.date()`,
 * `field.instant()`, and `field.datetime()`. `Type.Unsafe` decouples the emitted
 * JSON Schema from the inferred `Static<>`.
 *
 * NOTE on at-rest vs in-memory: a live TypeBox schema carries a non-enumerable
 * `~kind` tag that the CLOSED metas reject on a direct `recognize`. That tag is
 * dropped by JSON serialization, so the AT-REST form (what is stored on disk / in
 * Yjs and what `recognize` actually reads) classifies correctly. The round-trip
 * test serializes through JSON to mirror this.
 *
 * Closed sets are STRING-ONLY: `select` / `multiSelect` hold strings, not numbers
 * or booleans. A numeric range is an `integer` with `minimum` / `maximum`, not a
 * select. `json` is the one OPEN escape kind in the vocabulary: an arbitrary JSON
 * payload discriminated by the marker, not a `type`. Emptiness (`nullable`) is the
 * one axis NOT in the vocabulary: it is SUBSTRATE POLICY the workspace layers on with
 * its own standalone `nullable` wrapper, and matter forbids it. The vocabulary carries
 * kinds, never an emptiness policy.
