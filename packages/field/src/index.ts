/**
 * `@epicenter/field`: the closed field-type vocabulary.
 *
 * Two halves over ONE wire-form:
 * - `field.*` builders (authoring) construct a schema in the recognized form.
 * - `recognize` (recognition) classifies a stored schema back to its kind.
 *
 * They are inverses: `recognize` of a serialized `field.X(...)` is kind `X`.
 * `json` (the open escape kind) and {@link jsonValue} (its any-JSON inner) live here;
 * emptiness (`nullable`) does NOT, it is substrate policy each consumer layers on at
 * its own edge.
