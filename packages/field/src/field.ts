/**
 * The closed field palette, expressed as a META-SCHEMA (a schema OF schemas).
 *
 * A field's at-rest truth is a plain JSON Schema. This module answers the one
 * question about such a schema, through a single total entry point:
 *
 *   recognize(s) -> the kind whose closed meta matches, or null if `s` is outside
 *                   the palette (the rejection lane that degrades a field to raw).
 *
 * Each kind carries a CLOSED TypeBox object meta-schema (`additionalProperties:
 * false`). Two properties fall out of that closure and they are the whole point:
 *
 *   1. The metas are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. A `url` schema carries `format:'uri'`,
 *      which the bare-`string` meta forbids; an `instant` schema carries the exact
 *      UTC pattern, which the broad `datetime` meta forbids; a `select` schema
 *      carries `enum`, which every scalar meta forbids; a `multiSelect`'s items
 *      carry `enum`, which the `tags` item meta forbids. So at most one meta
 *      matches any legal schema, which means `recognize` needs no priority order
 *      and cannot be ambiguous.
 *   2. TYPOS DIE AT THE BOUNDARY. `{type:'strng'}` or `{type:'string', minLgth:1}`
 *      matches no meta, so `recognize` returns null and the field degrades to a raw
 *      column instead of silently rendering as `string`.
 *
 * Every meta reads `{ ...discriminators, ...refinements, ...annotations }`: three
 * buckets with one rule, only the DISCRIMINATORS differ across kinds.
 *
 *   discriminators  type / format / enum / items   the keys recognition reads.
 *   refinements     minLength.. / minimum.. / minItems..   closed per value-domain,
 *                   so a typo'd refinement key still dies, and the value constraint
 *                   rides along for free: a rating is `{type:'integer', minimum:1,
 *                   maximum:5}`, still kind `integer`, still validated, no new kind.
 *   annotations     title / description / default   inert metadata, IDENTICAL on
 *                   every meta. That identity is load-bearing: because the same
 *                   bucket is spread into every meta, an annotation can never tip
 *                   which kind matches, which is exactly why the bucket is safe to
 *                   widen. Held to the standard keywords with a real authoring path
 *                   into a field (`title`/`description` from the field builders,
 *                   `default` for a new-row default). `examples`, `$comment`,
 *                   `deprecated`, `readOnly`, `writeOnly`, `$id`, `$schema` are NOT
 *                   admitted: no path today, so a schema carrying one degrades to raw.
 *                   The day a real schema carries one and degrades is the signal to
 *                   add it here, not before.
 *
 * There is NO `nullable` / optional axis: optionality is not part of the vocabulary, so
 * a substrate that wants emptiness layers a nullable wrapper on top (the workspace's
 * `nullable`), and a nullable `anyOf`-with-null shape matches no meta here. Emptiness
 * stays SUBSTRATE POLICY, applied at each substrate's own edge.
 *
 * `json` IS a kind: an arbitrary-JSON payload cell. It is the one OPEN meta, discriminated
 * by an `x-json-schema` MARKER rather than by a `type` (see {@link JSON_SCHEMA_KEYWORD}).
 * `field.json(inner)` spreads the payload's own JSON Schema keywords (so a value still
 * validates) and adds the marker (so `recognize` classifies it as `json`); for an opaque
 * cell, `field.json(jsonValue)` carries the marker over a `Type.Any` payload and accepts
 * any JSON. The rejection lane is now `null`: a typo, a bare object, or a nullable wrapper
 * carries no marker and matches no meta, so it degrades to raw.
 *
 * Everything public is DERIVED from the one `FIELDS` object below: `Kind`,
 * `recognize`, `storageOf`, `KINDS`, `META_BY_KIND`. Adding a kind is one entry here,
 * plus its widget in the consuming app's component registry, which the compiler forces.
 *
 * This module also owns the VALUE side of a field schema through `compile` (the single
 * `Schema.Compile` that turns a stored schema into a per-cell validator). The
 * value-semantic formats it leans on (`uri` for `url`, `date` for `date`,
 * `date-time` for `datetime` / `instant`) are TypeBox standard formats,
 * registered for us when `typebox/schema` loads, so `compile` is just the call.
 * So one place answers both readings of a stored schema: "which kind is it"
 * (`recognize`) and "does this value satisfy it" (`compile`).
