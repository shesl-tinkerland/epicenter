 * The construction-time referential floor.
 *
 * `field.reference<T>(table)` declares that a column points at another table by carrying
 * the target table name in its at-rest schema (the `x-ref` marker the `@epicenter/field`
 * palette recognizes as kind `reference`). This module enforces the one guarantee that
 * turns that declaration into integrity at workspace construction: every reference target
 * must name a table defined in the SAME workspace. A typo (`field.reference('foldrs')`) or
 * a reference to a table that was never declared fails HERE, when the workspace is built,
 * instead of silently at query time.
 *
 * This is SCHEMA-level integrity: the target resolves to a real table. ROW-level
 * integrity (a stored value resolves to a real row id) needs the live data and is a
 * separate validator, not this construction-time check.
