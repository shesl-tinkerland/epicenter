/**
 * The branded `AgentId` type: the stable, durable address of an answering agent.
 *
 * An agent is a participant declared by configuration (a hosted cloud agent, an
 * always-on home daemon, a laptop daemon) with a fixed model, a curated toolset,
 * and a runtime. The `AgentId` is how a conversation names the one agent it is
 * bound to (`conversations.agent`, ADR-0015): the durable, human-authored address
 * that survives a redeploy or a move to a new machine, unlike the per-install
 * {@link NodeId} (transport identity) or the Yjs `clientID` (runtime CRDT identity)
 * that churn underneath it.
 *
 * Agent ids are authored in configuration, not generated: a constant like
 * `epicenter-cloud` for the hosted cloud agent, or a name a user gives a daemon.
 * Presence resolves a live `AgentId` to whatever `NodeId` currently hosts it.
