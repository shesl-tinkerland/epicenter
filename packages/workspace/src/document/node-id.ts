/**
 * Node id helper plus the branded `NodeId` type.
 *
 * A node id is a stable string that identifies one Epicenter app on one
 * persistent storage scope. Browser tabs sharing localStorage share an id;
 * separate browsers, the extension, Tauri windows, and the CLI daemon each
 * get distinct ids because their storage scopes are distinct. The id is
 * generated on first call and persisted in the supplied storage; subsequent
 * calls return the persisted value.
 *
 * "Node" is the identity concept behind a presence entry (`Peer`).
 * The id behind it is what the relay routes by and what every consumer reads.
 *
 * Node ids are claimed by the client and only the client knows them. They
 * are passed to `openCollaboration` as the `nodeId` config field, stamped
 * onto the WebSocket upgrade URL (the relay binds the id to the socket at
 * upgrade and stores it on the socket attachment for the lifetime of the
 * connection: no round-trip validation), and echoed as the `from` field on
 * every HTTP dispatch.
