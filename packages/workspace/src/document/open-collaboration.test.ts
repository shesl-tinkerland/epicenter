/**
 * Tests for `openCollaboration`.
 *
 * The fake `openWebSocket` resolves immediately with a socket that stays in
 * `CONNECTING` (we never call `onopen`), so the supervisor parks in
 * `attemptConnection`. That means these tests only cover the synchronous
 * setup of `openCollaboration`: the action-key guard and the `Symbol.dispose`
 * sugar. Socket-coupled behavior (presence routing, dispatch result routing,
 * disconnect settling) is intentionally out of scope here and needs a
 * different fake.
 *
 * The fake's `close() -> onclose` is what lets `ydoc.destroy()` unpark the
 * supervisor so the test process exits cleanly.
