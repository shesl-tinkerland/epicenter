/**
 * The one grammar every Y.Doc guid obeys.
 *
 * A guid is the single string that simultaneously:
 *   1. names a Cloudflare Durable Object (the sync room),
 *   2. names an on-disk SQLite file (`<guid>.db`),
 *   3. keys the browser IndexedDB store,
 *   4. names the cross-tab BroadcastChannel (`yjs.<guid>`),
 *   5. is the HKDF domain-separation label for the workspace key.
 *
 * One string, five sinks. The charset below is the intersection that is safe
 * in all of them with zero transformation:
 *
 *   - lowercase `a-z` and digits `0-9`: the universally safe core. Lowercase
 *     is not cosmetic. Case-insensitive filesystems (default macOS, Windows)
 *     fold `Foo` and `foo` to the same file, so allowing uppercase would let
 *     two distinct guids collide on disk.
 *   - `-` joins words inside a segment (`tab-manager`). Safe in URLs and
 *     filenames; never percent-encoded.
 *   - `.` is RESERVED as the segment separator and therefore forbidden inside
 *     a segment. Reserving it to one job is what makes composed guids
 *     injective: `workspace.collection.row.field` cannot be re-parsed into any
 *     other tuple, because the three trailing segments contain no dots.
 *
 * Excluded on purpose: `:` (illegal in macOS/Windows filenames), `/`, `_`,
 * spaces, uppercase, leading/trailing/double hyphens, and the Windows
 * reserved node names (`con`, `nul`, ...), any of which would break one of
 * the five sinks.
