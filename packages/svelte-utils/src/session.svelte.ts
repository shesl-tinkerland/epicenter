 * Auth-gated identity payload that `createSession` hands to the build
 * callback whenever an identity-bearing auth state is present.
 *
 * Flat shape: the auth client is not exposed. Every field is something an
 * app opener actually consumes:
 *
 * - `createWorkspace({ id, keyring: signedIn.keyring, tables, kv })`
 * - `attachLocalStorage(workspace.ydoc, { server, ownerId, keyring })`
 * - `openCollaboration(workspace.ydoc, { openWebSocket, onReconnectSignal })`
 * - `roomWsUrl({ baseURL, ownerId, guid, deviceId })`
 *
 * `server` and `baseURL` are both projected because `roomWsUrl` wants the
 * full origin (for the ws:// vs wss:// scheme) while local-storage partition
 * names want the host alone.
 *
 * `ownerId` is stable for the lifetime of a single `SignedIn`: a
 * different-owner sign-in produces a new payload via the session's dispose /
 * rebuild cycle. `keyring` is a callback because the same-owner keyring can
 * rotate (reauth-required to identity-bearing) without a rebuild.
 *
 * Deployment shape (personal vs shared) is not on this payload; it is a property
 * of the server (see `OwnerId` in `@epicenter/identity`).

/**
 * Auth-gated payload built once per identity-bearing auth state and disposed
 * on sign-out. `reauth-required` keeps the existing payload mounted: OAuth
 * sessions publish a signed-out gap before a different owner mounts, so two
 * consecutive identity-bearing states are always the same owner.
 *
 * The build callback receives a `SignedIn` value with everything an app
 * opener needs: server + baseURL for transport, ownerId for partitioning,
 * keyring (callback) for encryption, and the two auth functions
 * (`openWebSocket`, `onReconnectSignal`) for cloud sync. The keyring reader
 * pulls from the live `state.keyring` so refreshed keyrings from
 * `/api/session` are picked up by the next `createWorkspace` or
 * `attachLocalStorage` construction without rebuilding the payload. Each
 * construction snapshots the keyring exactly once; nothing re-reads it
 * mid-attach.
 *
 * Requires a `SyncAuthClient` (it threads `auth.openWebSocket` into the payload
 * for cloud sync) whose `state` is Svelte-reactive (use `@epicenter/svelte/auth`,
 * not `@epicenter/auth` directly). A same-origin cookie client is a plain
 * `AuthClient` and cannot be passed here.
