/**
 * The portable env contract `@epicenter/server` reads, as BOTH an arktype
 * schema (the runtime value) and its inferred type (the same name, the
 * `AuthUser` convention). It is the `Env.Bindings` type the Hono context uses
 * (see types.ts) and the SSOT a Bun host validates `process.env` against at
 * boot (see apps/api/server.ts).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `Cloudflare.Env` (ADR-0066): it lists only the portable
 * STRING secrets library code reads, so library code names no Cloudflare type
 * and a Bun host typechecks AND validates with no Cloudflare types in scope.
 * Because every member is a string, a Bun entry runs the schema over
 * `process.env` and gets a typed env with no cast; a missing or malformed
 * secret fails fast with a descriptive error instead of a downstream surprise.
 *
 * What is deliberately ABSENT, and why:
 * - Object / namespace bindings (`ROOM` Durable Object, `HYPERDRIVE`) are not
 *   strings and cannot be validated from `process.env`. They live on the
 *   deployment's own `Cloudflare.Env` and are read by deployment resolvers at
 *   the `apps/*` edge (`resolveRooms`, `connectDb`), never by library code
 *   reaching for a binding shape. With the assets route retired into the
 *   portable blob store, the library now names NO Cloudflare object binding,
 *   by value or by type.
 * - The deployment's public origin and any cloud-only secrets (Autumn, admin
 *   IDs) are deployment config, supplied through `resolveOrigin` / policies.
 *
 * Each deployment's real env is a superset assignable to this: apps/api asserts
 * `satisfies ServerBindings` on its generated `Cloudflare.Env`, apps/self-host
 * declares `extends ServerBindings`, and the Bun host's validated `process.env`
 * is exactly this shape.
