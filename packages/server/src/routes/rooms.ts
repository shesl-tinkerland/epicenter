/**
 * Rooms sub-app: one Cloudflare Durable Object per named Y.Doc.
 *
 * URL shape (uniform across modes): `/api/owners/:ownerId/rooms/:roomId`.
 * The deployment mounts auth and `requireOwnership` upstream;
 * `requireOwnership` resolves the partition from `(rule, user.id)`,
 * rejects URL `:ownerId` mismatches at the boundary, and populates
 * `c.var.ownerId` before this handler runs.
 *
 * The Durable Object name is the owner-partitioned identifier produced by
 * {@link doName}; nothing here interpolates strings inline. The DO itself
 * is owner-blind: every connection is identified by the
 * `(userId, nodeId)` pair stamped onto its WebSocket attachment.
 *
 * Each HTTP/WS access pushes a fire-and-forget upsert into
 * `c.var.afterResponse` so the platform-level `durableObjectInstance`
 * table tracks which owner's DO was touched and when. The row is keyed by
 * `do_name` and partitioned by `owner_id`; account-delete cleanup matches
 * `owner_id` (see auth `before(delete)` hook).
