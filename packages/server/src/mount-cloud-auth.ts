/**
 * `mountCloudAuth`: the cloud-only relational-auth layer (Better Auth + Postgres).
 *
 * The hosted cloud composes Better Auth: a per-request `c.var.auth` instance
 * (sessions, OAuth, JWKS) over Postgres, plus the `authApp` surface (sign-in,
 * consent, OAuth metadata, and the Better Auth catch-all). The single-partition
 * instance composes NEITHER (ADR-0075): it authenticates one operator-supplied
 * bearer and has no sessions, so it never calls this and never constructs Better
 * Auth. That is the seam that lets an instance drop Postgres entirely.
 *
 * Call it once, right after `createServerApp` and before the owner-scoped mounts:
 * it installs the auth-context middleware (so `c.var.auth` is set before any
 * cookie-or-bearer wrapper or `authApp` route reads it) and mounts `authApp` at
 * the root.
