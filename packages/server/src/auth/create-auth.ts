 * {@link ServerBindings}: the relational-auth substrate is a Cloud-only layer, so
 * its env contract is too, and the single-partition instance's env never inherits
 * secrets it does not read (ADR-0076). The cloud threads it onto
 * `c.var.authSecrets` (mount-cloud-auth.ts) from its own deploy-gated env, the
 * same honest-edge move every Cloudflare-only binding already makes (ADR-0066),
 * so both readers (this builder and the `authApp` sign-in page) take it from one
 * resolved value rather than reaching into the raw `c.env` bag.
 *
 * `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is required: every deployment that reaches this composes
 * Better Auth and must sign sessions with a real secret (the runtime gate below
 * is defense-in-depth against an empty value). Each OAuth provider is optional
 * and register-when-present (ADR-0071): a deployment configures the ones it has
 * an app for, or none; an absent provider is simply not offered, never a button
 * that 500s.

		// Set-Cookie browsers would drop. That is not how this deploys: the only
		// caller of `/auth/sign-in/social` is the API-hosted sign-in page
		// (auth-pages/scripts/sign-in.ts), which fetches a same-origin relative
		// URL, so the state cookie is first-party, stored, and sent on the
