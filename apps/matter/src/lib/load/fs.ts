/**
 * The Node filesystem boundary: turn a directory on disk into the in-memory {@link TableInput}s
 * that `assess` classifies. The pure transforms (`readTable`, `assess`) never touch disk; this is
 * the one place that does, so the whole pipeline is testable without a filesystem and the listing
 * is not duplicated per surface.
 *
 * This is the single home for the disk listing the CLI (`src/cli/check.ts`) and the app surfaces
 * share, instead of each writing their own copy: list a folder's
 * `.md` files, read each (a read failure becomes an unreadable entry, never a dropped file), and
 * read its `matter.json`. {@link loadTable} loads one folder; {@link loadPath} is the entry point
 * that classifies a path as a marked table or a container of marked children.
 *
 * A `matter.json` MARKS a table (ADR-0029): a folder is a table if and only if it contains one.
 * A container loads only its marked immediate children and skips the rest (an unmarked folder is
 * not data: an attachment bundle, a junk dir, an organizational folder). The marker can be `{}`
 * (an untyped raw grid), a `fields` map (typed), or junk (a claimed-but-broken table); its
 * contents type the table but never decide whether it IS one.
 *
 * It emits {@link TableInput} (the shape `assess` classifies) because a filesystem is exactly
 * where "could not read this folder" originates, and `TableInput`'s `unreadable` variant is the
 * one input that carries that fact into `assess`. A folder whose listing fails (missing,
 * permission) becomes that variant.
