/**
 * A live Vault: one directory of typed markdown Tables, read as one relational unit.
 *
 * This is the layer above {@link createTable}. A Table watches ONE folder's files; a Vault watches
 * the ROOT (`watch_vault`, depth-1) for its table set changing, and composes a `createTable` per
 * table the watcher resolves. `watch_vault` applies the same marker rule as the CLI loader
 * (`load/fs.ts` `loadPath`, ADR-0029/0032): a folder is a table XOR a container of tables. A marked
 * root IS the single table (its subfolders are ignored); an unmarked root is a container whose
 * immediate marked child folders are the tables. An unmarked folder is not data and is skipped, so
 * opening a marked leaf and opening a container of marked folders both work; depth is reached by
 * re-opening the deeper folder, never by loading two levels at once. The marker's contents type a
 * Table; its presence is what makes the folder a Table at all. It owns its Tables' lifetimes:
 * dispose the Vault and every Table watch and the root watch stop. The Vault declares nothing
 * itself: it is the live union of its Tables' self-declared contracts, discovered, not configured.
 *
 * Why this exists: references only have meaning across two Tables of the SAME Vault
 * (`adaptations.page -> pages`), so resolution is a Vault-level operation. The Vault holds every
 * Table together, runs `assess` over all of them at once, and exposes ONE live {@link
 * VaultIntegrity} that the grid, the Table switcher, and the integrity panel all select from. The
 * single open table case is just a degenerate Vault of one Table.
 *
 * The Vault also composes the vault's SQLite mirror ({@link createMirror}): one hidden
 * `<root>/.matter/matter.sqlite` holding one SQL table per folder, so an agent or SQL console can
 * JOIN across the whole vault (`FROM pages JOIN adaptations`). The Vault wires each Table's onChange
 * to `mirror.syncTable` and drops a table's slice when its folder leaves; the mirror owns the db
 * lifecycle itself. It is a PROJECTION only: `assess` owns every reference verdict; SQL never resolves
 * references.
 *
 * Desktop-only: it talks to Tauri directly (no platform seam), mirroring {@link createTable}.
