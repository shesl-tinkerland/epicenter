/**
 * The Kind -> Field component map: the UI layer's half of the contract whose
 * model half is `recognize` (schema -> Kind) in `@epicenter/field`. Keeping them separate
 * is the point: the model layer derives the kind and stays free of component imports;
 * this layer maps the kind to a widget.
 *
 * `satisfies Record<Kind, FieldComponent>` IS the exhaustiveness guarantee: add a
 * kind to the palette and this object fails to compile until its Field exists. A
 * missing kind is caught at the map literal, not at a render fallthrough. `number`
 * and `integer` share `NumericField`; `multiSelect` and `tags` are both string lists
 * but FORK their editors (a closed-enum combobox vs free chip entry), so each has its
 * own widget. `json` is the arbitrary-JSON kind (a JSON-text editor); the rejection
 * lane is now a recognize `null` (an unmarked shape outside the palette), not a missing
 * widget, so `Kind` is exactly the renderable set.
