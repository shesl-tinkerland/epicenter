/**
 * The contract every per-kind Field component implements.
 *
 * A Field renders AND edits one cell whose value is in its kind's domain (`OK`)
 * or empty (`NEEDS_VALUE`). It NEVER handles `INVALID`: an out-of-domain
 * value cannot fit a typed widget, so the {@link ModeledCell} wrapper routes those
 * to the universal JSON repair editor before a Field is ever chosen. Kind dispatch
 * is gated behind validity, so a Field only ever sees a value it can represent.
 *
 * A Field's one job is to COMMIT a value in its kind's domain (including the empty
 * but present values `""` and `[]`); it never deletes the key. Deleting the key
 * (clearing the cell back to NEEDS_VALUE) is shared cell chrome owned by
 * {@link ModeledCell}, the same control for every kind, so no Field decides if or
 * how to expose a clear affordance.
 *
 * A Field owns its own open/editing local state (the keystroke-buffer island) and
 * writes through {@link SaveField}; it never mutates the projection. The vault
 * reclassifies the row from the written bytes (and the watcher re-confirms it), so
 * a value that leaves the kind's domain reappears as INVALID (handled by the
 * wrapper, not the Field).
