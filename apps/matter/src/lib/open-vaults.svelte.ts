/**
 * The set of open vaults: the tabs.
 *
 * Multi-vault state is split three ways, and this file owns only the durable slice.
 * WHICH vault is active lives in the URL (`/vault/[id]`); the LIVE watcher lives in
 * the route component (construct on mount, dispose on destroy). All that is left is
 * WHICH folders are open: a small persisted list of `{ id, path, name }` that
 * survives relaunch so the tabs come back. The `id` is opaque and URL-safe so the
 * route can carry it; `/vault/[id]` resolves it back to a `path` via {@link get}.
 *
 * Replaces the old `vaultSession` singleton: where that held ONE `current` vault and
 * drove its lifetime, this holds only the list of tabs and the open/close actions.
 * SvelteKit's router owns everything else, so there is no `Map<id, Vault>`, no
 * `activeId`, and no manual dispose policy here.
