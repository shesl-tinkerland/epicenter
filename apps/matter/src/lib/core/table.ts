/**
 * Read a table's folder of markdown into the contract, then classify it.
 *
 * This is the pure transform: given each file's path and raw content (and an
 * optional `matter.json` text), it produces the readable rows, the unreadable
 * files (kept separate, never dropped), and EITHER a typed classification (a
 * valid `matter.json` was supplied) OR a raw untyped view (no contract, or junk
 * contract). The actual disk listing lives at the boundary (`table.svelte.ts` in
 * the app, `src/cli/check.ts` in the headless command), so this transform is
 * testable without any filesystem.
 *
 * The contract is the foundation, never inference: a usable `matter.json` classifies
 * the folder against a contract; without one, the folder is shown as RAW text
 * (no type guessing). A junk contract degrades to the raw view with a diagnostic the
 * UI can show as a non-blocking banner. The headless check command is stricter
 * about missing or junk contracts because it has to certify the folder.
