/**
 * The composed integrity model: one walk that classifies a whole vault.
 *
 * Conformance answers a single table's question (is each cell present, valid, missing) the
 * instant ONE folder is read. Reference resolution is a strictly LATER refinement that needs
 * sibling tables to have loaded. `assess` is the seam where the later data, once present,
 * refines the earlier classification: it widens each per-cell `Cell` into an `AssessedCell`,
 * replacing a reference cell's transient `OK` with the cross-table verdict (resolved / dangling
 * / missing-target) and passing every other cell through unchanged.
 *
 * The point of the composition is that the walk happens ONCE. `assess` returns a rich
 * `VaultIntegrity` that every surface (the grid, the integrity panel, the CLI, the `--json`
 * output) reads as a pure SELECTOR. A `resolved` reference cell carries its target `Row`, so a
 * chip renders the target's title with no second lookup, and the panel and the grid cannot
 * disagree because they read the same cells.
 *
 * `assess` owns the reference classification directly off ONE index. It builds `rowsByTable`
 * (per table, stem to Row over the readable tables) and reads each reference cell's verdict
 * straight from it: the target table absent is `missing-target`, a matched stem is `resolved`
 * (the row is right there in the map), an unmatched stem is `dangling`. Resolution is a single
 * lookup per cell, with no second stem graph or flat findings list to re-index. Reporting the
 * one `missing-target` per column (rather than per row) is a projection concern that lives in
 * `toViolations`, not here.
 *
 * `conformance.ts` is untouched: it keeps producing the four-state `Cell`, and `assess` owns the
 * `Cell -> AssessedCell` widening. The reference verdict is layered on top of conformance, never
 * folded into it.
