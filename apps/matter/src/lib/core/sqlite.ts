/**
 * The SQLite projector: turn a folder's VALID rows into a typed table.
 *
 * `matter.sqlite` sits next to `matter.json` as a derived, disposable, READ-ONLY
 * mirror so a coding agent (or an in-app SQL console) can run arbitrary SQL over the
 * typed folder. The live in-app grid stays reactive JS over the projection; this is
 * the external read surface, not the app's query engine.
 *
 * This module is the PURE half: given the model and the classified rows, it produces
 * the schema script (`DROP` + `CREATE`) and the row tuples to insert. The impure half
 * (writing the file) is a thin Tauri command that runs the script and parameter-binds
 * the rows; keeping serialization here makes it unit-testable with no filesystem.
 *
 * Three properties define the table:
 *   - Every READABLE row, valid or not. A folder of drafts is mostly incomplete, and
 *     the whole point of the WHERE filter (and of an agent triaging the folder) is to
 *     find those drafts ("my carousel posts that still need a publishDate"), so a row
 *     is included whether or not every field is filled. Only unparseable FILES are
 *     absent, they never became a row; their broken text stays in the markdown.
 *   - Field columns are nullable. A missing required cell (NEEDS_VALUE) binds NULL; an
 *     out-of-domain value (INVALID) binds its raw value, which SQLite's flexible typing
 *     stores regardless of the column's declared affinity. So a draft is still
 *     filterable on the fields it does have.
 *   - No CHECK. Validation lives once, at classify time (the grid shows conformance per
 *     cell, amber for empty, red for out-of-domain); the mirror just mirrors, so a SQL
 *     CHECK would only reject the very drafts the filter exists to surface.
