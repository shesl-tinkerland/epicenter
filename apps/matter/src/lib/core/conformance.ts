/**
 * Conformance: classify a folder's rows against its contract.
 *
 * Typed fields have row-completeness policy, so the per-cell split is FOUR states:
 *
 *   v == null ? (required ? MISSING_REQUIRED : MISSING_OPTIONAL) : check(v) ? OK : INVALID
 *
 * MISSING_REQUIRED and MISSING_OPTIONAL are the two missing states. Both cover an
 * absent key OR an explicit null; the nullish contract says a bare `title:` in YAML
 * parses to null and must mean the same as an omitted `title`. Missing required cells
 * need attention. Missing optional cells are valid. "Ready to publish" is "every cell
 * is OK or MISSING_OPTIONAL", which is also "the row projects into the typed table".
 *
 * The validator is precompiled on the {@link Field} (built once at contract load in
 * `validateContract`), so classification never recompiles; it reads `field.check`.
 *
 * Extras (frontmatter keys not in the contract's fields) are orthogonal: collected for
 * the per-row expander, never affecting validity. A field whose shape was outside the
 * palette is not a typed field, so its value also surfaces here as an extra.

 * parallel array). {@link Cell} unions the four; consumers use focused exported
