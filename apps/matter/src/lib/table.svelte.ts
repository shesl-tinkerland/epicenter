/**
 * A live Table: one folder on disk, read as one typed table.
 *
 * The folder is the truth and other processes write it (agents, your editor, git),
 * so the table is not a one-shot read: a single `watch_folder` command arms a
 * native folder watcher (backed by `notify`), pushes the folder's current
 * contents as a first batch, then streams a batch per debounced change. Each
 * pushed delta is self-contained ({@link FileDelta}: a file name plus the file's
 * observable state), so the JS never round-trips a separate read. External
 * updates, the seed scan, AND the app's own successful writes all flow through
 * ONE path (`applyDeltas`) into ONE `SvelteMap`.
 *
 * Lifecycle: opening a table IS observing it, so the watcher starts at
 * construction. `whenReady` resolves once it is armed (the seed scan has run, so
 * the store holds the folder's current contents) and rejects if it cannot be, which
 * the UI gates on with `{#await}`. `dispose()` stops the OS watch. The keyed route
 * component (`/vault/[id]`) owns one table's lifetime, constructing it on mount and
 * disposing it on destroy, so no module singleton or standing effect drives the
 * watcher; the set of open tabs is just a persisted list (`open-vaults.svelte.ts`).
 * A Vault that composes many tables (one per child folder) is the next layer up;
 * see the vault-as-relational-unit spec.
 *
 * Desktop-only: it talks to Tauri directly (no platform seam). Develop with
 * `bun run tauri dev`.
