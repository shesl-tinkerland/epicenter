# Whispering App

Tauri + Svelte 5 desktop/web app for voice transcription.

## Key Points

- Three-layer architecture: Service -> Query -> UI
- Services are pure functions returning `Result<T, E>`
- Build-time platform seams use `#platform/*` imports. Load `workspace-app-composition` before changing those seams.
- Tauri-only capabilities live in `$lib/tauri.tauri.ts`; shared consumers go through `#platform/*`.
- Query layer handles reactivity, caching, and error transformation
- See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed patterns

## Don'ts

- Don't put business logic in Svelte components
- Don't access settings directly in services (pass as parameters)
- Don't use try-catch; use wellcrafted Result types

## Tauri Commands

Load `tauri` before adding or changing Tauri commands, permissions,
capabilities, generated bindings, or platform filesystem behavior. Load
`rust-errors` when a command changes Rust error payloads consumed by
TypeScript.

Every command change must keep `make_specta_builder()` in
`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, generated bindings, and `src/lib/tauri/commands.ts` in
sync. The command boundary file is the only place in `src/lib/**` that may
import `invoke` from `@tauri-apps/api/core` for app commands.
