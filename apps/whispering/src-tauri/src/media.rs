//! Pause and resume system media playback around recording.
//!
//! The frontend `recordingMedia` chain calls `pause_playback` on capture start
//! and `resume_playback` on capture end, trading opaque `String` session tokens:
//! `pause_playback` returns a token for each session it paused, and the frontend
//! hands that same set back to `resume_playback`. Token contents are
//! platform-private (macOS output-active bundle ids, Windows AUMIDs, Linux MPRIS
//! bus names) and the frontend never interprets them.
//!
//! Recording never waits on, and never fails because of, playback control: both
//! commands are infallible across IPC and the caller fires and forgets. Platform
//! failures are logged on the Rust side, never surfaced to the frontend (which
//! has no recovery for them). One platform module is compiled per target;
//! unsupported targets are silent no-ops.
