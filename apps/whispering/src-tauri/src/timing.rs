//! Flag-gated latency instrumentation for the desktop audio pipeline.
//!
//! The number we optimize is "user stops speaking -> transcript delivered".
//! To decide which optimization is worth building (and prove it with real
//! numbers instead of vibes), the budget components log their wall time on the
//! `whispering::timing` target when `WHISPERING_TIMING` is set in the
//! environment. Unset (the default, including release builds), every helper is
//! a branch-and-return: no clock read, no allocation, no log line.
//!
//! Read the spans with:
//!
//! ```sh
//! WHISPERING_TIMING=1 bun run --cwd apps/whispering tauri dev 2>&1 | grep '\[timing\]'
//! ```
//!
//! This module is deliberately shipped *before* the optimizations it measures.
//! Its whole job is to settle, on real hardware, whether the disk round-trip
//! (write + fsync + read + decode) and the cold model load are big enough to be
//! worth removing. See
//! `specs/20260617T170000-desktop-audio-pipeline-greenfield.md`.
