/**
 * The exception projection over the dictation lifecycle. A manual failure
 * glances on the pill, and a VAD failure does not show there at all, so the
 * durable cross-app signal is the OS notification: every real failure fires it,
 * focused or not, because VAD runs unattended and shows nothing on the live pill
 * (ADR-0039). Detail and retry live on the recordings row, not here.
 *
 * A reduced delivery reach is not a failure: the transcript is saved, so it never
 * reaches this projection. It surfaces on the pill instead (a `clipboard` or
 * `history` tag that persists until the next dictation), which is enough because
 * the dominant `history` cause, a revoked Accessibility grant, already raises its
 * own standing notice.
 *
 * There is no toast and no `MoreDetailsDialog`. `report.warning` and
 * standing-condition warnings (revoked Accessibility, dead listener) are a
 * different, present-tense path and are untouched.
