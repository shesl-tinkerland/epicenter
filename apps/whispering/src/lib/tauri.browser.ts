 * inactive), so `@tauri-apps/*` stays out of the browser bundle.
 *
 * The `Tauri` type is re-exported (type-only, erased at build) so consumers
 * that `import type { Tauri } from '#platform/tauri'` resolve it under both
 * the web (`default`) and Tauri conditions.

 * `tauriOnly` is intentionally absent: it is for `*.tauri.ts` files, which
 * import it directly from `./tauri.tauri`. Shared or web code reaching for it
 * fails the build instead of shipping a runtime assertion.

// violation means the build resolved the `default` (web) condition instead of
// `tauri`, so `@tauri-apps/*` is missing from the bundle even though the
// runtime supports it, and the app silently masquerades as the web app. The
// usual cause is a stale `dev:web` server squatting on the dev port, which
// `tauri dev` then connects to instead of its own. Read the raw
// `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` marker rather than `isTauri()` from `@tauri-apps/api`,
// which would pull Tauri into the web bundle; `typeof window` keeps it inert
// during SSR.
