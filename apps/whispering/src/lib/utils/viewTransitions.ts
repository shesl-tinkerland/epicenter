	 * is incidental and does not participate here.
	 *
	 * Bind it to the glyph only at rest. Once a recording is live the topbar
	 * swaps to a stop control, which is a different object and must not inherit
	 * this name. Both home tabs render at once, but `manual` and `vad` are
	 * distinct names, so they never collide; the topbar carries only the
	 * selected one.
