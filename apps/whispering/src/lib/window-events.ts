/**
 * A typed channel for one window-to-window Tauri event that carries a payload.
 *
 * Tauri's raw `emit(name, payload)` / `listen<T>(name)` pair has no type link
 * from the event name to its payload: a listener's `T` is asserted by hand and
 * never checked against what the emitter actually sends. `defineWindowEvent`
 * binds the name and payload once across `emit`, `emitTo`, and `listen`, so
 * emitter and listener can't drift without a compile error. Use
 * `defineWindowSignal` for an event that carries nothing.
 *
 * Scope: frontend-to-frontend only (one webview window telling another to do
 * something). Events that cross the Rust boundary stay on the generated Specta
 * `events` (e.g. `shortcutTriggerEvent`), which are typed from the Rust
 * definitions. Don't route a window-to-window event through Rust just to borrow
 * Specta's types; Rust has no part in it.
