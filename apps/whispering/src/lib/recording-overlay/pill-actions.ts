 * The pill's control gestures, mapped to operations in one place. Both pill
 * mounts route through here so the gesture-to-operation rules live once: the web
 * host calls this directly, and the Tauri main window calls it from the overlay's
 * action IPC. The pill component itself stays presentational.
 *
 * Stop and cancel act only on a live capture. VAD has no cancel (its pill shows
 * no cancel button), so a stray cancel during a VAD session is a no-op. `ship-raw`
 * is the exception: the Polish pass runs after capture is idle, so it cancels the
 * in-flight completion through `polishHud` rather than a recorder (ADR 0041).
 * There is no retry gesture: a failed dictation is retried from its recordings row.
