/**
 * A capture surface is one of the three ways to start a transcription from the
 * home page or the config header: the two microphone triggers (`manual`, `vad`)
 * plus `import` (file import, shown to the user as "Upload File").
 *
 * `manual` and `vad` mirror the durable `recording.trigger` setting (they have a
 * device, a shortcut, an overlay, and live capture). `import` is deliberately
 * NOT a trigger: it has none of those, so it never persists and never writes
 * `recording.trigger`. It's a transient presentational overlay, owned by
 * `capture-surface.svelte.ts`. Modeling it only here, layered on top of the
 * triggers, restores the old three-way UI choice without re-conflating import
 * back into the trigger setting (the split made in `17dbd3c14`).
