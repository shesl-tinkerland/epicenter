 * Which capture surface the home page and the config header are currently
 * showing: a microphone trigger (`manual`/`vad`) or the file-import overlay
 * (`import`).
 *
 * This is a thin, transient presentation layer over the durable
 * `recording.trigger` setting. `manual`/`vad` read straight through to that
 * setting; `import` is a module-level boolean that is never persisted (file
 * import is a one-shot, so each launch starts on your durable trigger) and
 * never written back to `recording.trigger`. Keeping it here, rather than as a
 * third trigger value, is what lets the UI offer the three-way choice while the
 * trigger setting stays strictly `manual | vad`.
 *
 * It lives at module scope so the home tabs and the header dropdown share one
 * selection. This module is a leaf: the orchestration that runs when you switch
 * surfaces (stopping a live recorder, switching the trigger) lives in
 * `operations/recording.ts`, which calls `showImport`/`dismissImport` here.
