/**
 * The dictation lifecycle owned by the main window. See ADR-0039.
 *
 * Voice-activated capture is *continuous*: an utterance transcribes while the
 * session keeps listening, so a live meter and a pipeline outcome run at once.
 * Manual capture is sequential. Two facts keep both honest:
 *
 * - `capture` is *derived* from the recorder machines: the live session, with no
 *   second copy of "are we recording" to drift.
 * - `outcome` is the most-recent utterance's pipeline result, an ephemeral signal
 *   the pipeline drives. Most-recent-wins: a new utterance overwrites it, and the
 *   OS-notification path reads it and wants each distinct failure exactly once.
 *
 * A failure is transient here, not a held state: the pill glances it (manual),
 * the notification fires it (when unfocused), and the recordings row is the
 * durable record. The pill is not a review surface, so there is no failure latch.
