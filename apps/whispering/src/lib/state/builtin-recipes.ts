/**
 * The built-in Recipes that ship in code, shown in the picker and the library
 * alongside the user's own. They cover the reshapes the category leans on
 * (Wispr Flow, Apple Writing Tools): an email, a reply, notes, a to-do list.
 * There is deliberately no "Clean" recipe; Polish owns meaning-preserving
 * cleanup on the automatic path, so a manual one would only duplicate it.
 *
 * Each is a plain {@link Recipe}: a name and one instruction, text in and text
 * out. Built-in ids carry the `builtin:` prefix so they never collide with a
 * user recipe's generated id, and so the library can show them read-only (a user
 * edits a copy, not the shipped original). See ADR 0041.
