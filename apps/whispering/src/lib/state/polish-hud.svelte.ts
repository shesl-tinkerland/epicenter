 * Owns the `AbortController` for the in-flight Polish pass, so the pill's "ship

 * The pill's *display* during Polish is a projection of the dictation lifecycle
 * (the `polishing` outcome, see `dictation-lifecycle`), the same as every other
 * phase. This module is only the cancellation seam: the pipeline calls `begin()`
 * to get a signal and `end()` when the pass settles; the overlay's "ship raw"
 * action calls `shipRaw()`. Lives outside the pipeline because two owners touch
 * it: the pipeline (imperative) and the overlay action handler (reactive).
