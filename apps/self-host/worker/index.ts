/**
 * Epicenter self-hosted instance Worker (Cloudflare; ADR-0075).
 *
 * The instance on Cloudflare: the SAME `@epicenter/server` composition the Bun
 * entry (`server.ts`) builds, wired to Cloudflare bindings instead of plain
 * primitives (ADR-0066). One single-partition instance, not a multi-user wiki and not
 * a mode: ownership is `instance()` (every request resolves to the pinned
 * `owners/instance` partition), and authentication is one operator-supplied static
 * bearer (`INSTANCE_TOKEN`), constant-time compared. No OAuth, no allowlist, no
 * sessions. "Solo" vs "shared" is only how many people hold the token.
 *
 * This is a reference, not an Epicenter-operated product. Copy this folder, set
 * `INSTANCE_TOKEN` (`wrangler secret put INSTANCE_TOKEN`, generated with
 * `bun run gen-token`), provision your Durable Object binding, and deploy. The
 * instance composes no Better Auth and no Postgres, so there is no Hyperdrive
 * binding and no `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (ADR-0075). Community-supported.
 *
 * Trust boundary: the deployer operates the infrastructure. Epicenter never holds
 * or sees the data stored here, so self-hosting is functionally zero-knowledge
 * against Epicenter.

// entry runs at boot, so a missing or weak token fails closed on Cloudflare too
// (ADR-0075's entropy floor): a Worker has no boot phase, so the gate runs per
// request and a throw surfaces as a 500 instead of admitting a weak credential. It
// also returns the trimmed token, so there is no `?? ''` coalesce whose removal
// could silently let an unset secret reach the compare.
