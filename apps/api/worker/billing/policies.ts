/**
 * Cloud-only deployment policies that wrap `@epicenter/server` mount
 * primitives with Autumn-backed billing.
 *
 * Each policy is a thin shell around the billing service. The service owns
 * the Autumn round-trips and the AI reservation lock (the `lockId` never
 * leaves it); policies own only HTTP shape: pulling fields off the request,
 * forwarding the guard's typed error to `c.json`, and pushing after-response
 * settlement/sync work onto the queue from `@epicenter/server`. Those ops
 * return a `Result` (they never reject) and the adapter logs any provider
 * failure at its source, so a failed finalize or storage sync is recorded
 * rather than silently swallowed by the queue's `Promise.allSettled`, with no
 * separate settlement wrapper needed.
 *
 *   chargeOpenAiCreditsWithAutumn  Around `/v1/chat/completions` (the
 *                                  OpenAI-compatible gateway). Reserves credits
 *                                  (a lock) before the call, then confirms on
 *                                  success or releases on a pre-stream failure.
 *                                  The gateway is house-key-only, so every call
 *                                  is metered (ADR-0054): no BYOK bypass.
 *
 *   chargeOpenAiTranscriptionCredits  Around `/v1/audio/transcriptions` (the STT
 *                                  gateway). Meters by audio duration: a cheap
 *                                  pre-gate denies an empty wallet, then on a 200
 *                                  the per-minute charge is tracked from the
 *                                  returned `duration`. Settle-after, so the cost
 *                                  is known (no reservation lock). House-key-only.
 *
 * AI reservations use Autumn's lock + `balances.finalize` rather than
 * deduct-then-refund: if the worker dies before finalizing, Autumn
 * auto-releases the hold at its TTL, so a failed request can never silently
 * overcharge. When the provider is unreachable the guard returns a structured
 * `BillingError` (fail closed), so the surface answers with a billing envelope
 * instead of a naked 500.
 *
 * The content-addressed blob store is unmetered in v1 (no storage policy here):
 * Autumn `check()` denies by default with no plan attached, so deferred quota
 * means not calling it. A `syncBlobStorageWithAutumn` policy slots in when blob
 * storage is billed (deleted spec 20260623T220000 decision 10, recoverable via git history; kernel is ADR-0088).
 *
 * The library remains billing-agnostic; everything here is cloud-only.
