 * `autumn-js` directly: every Autumn response is mapped to the Epicenter
 * DTO inside the service before it crosses the HTTP boundary.
 *
 * Field naming is Epicenter-shaped, not Autumn-shaped. For example, the
 * checkout result exposes `checkoutUrl` (nullable when no payment is
 * required) rather than Autumn's `paymentUrl`; the portal endpoint
 * returns `{ portalUrl: string }` rather than a vendor envelope.
