# Whispering Redirects

Whispering now lives in `EpicenterHQ/epicenter`:

- Source: `https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter/tree/main/apps/whispering`
- Downloads: `https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter/releases/latest`
- Web app: `https://whispering.epicenter.so`
- Product page: `https://epicenter.so/whispering`

Keep `braden-w/whispering` archived. It preserves old issues, stars, forks, and release links, but its README should stay pointed at the current source and release locations. GitHub repository redirects are useful for renamed or transferred repositories, but they do not redirect cleanly to a subdirectory inside a monorepo.

## Redirect Targets

Use permanent redirects for old public domains:

| Old URL | Target |
| --- | --- |
| `https://getwhispering.com/*` | `https://epicenter.so/whispering` |
| `https://www.getwhispering.com/*` | `https://epicenter.so/whispering` |
| `https://whispering.studio/*` | `https://whispering.epicenter.so` |
| `https://www.whispering.studio/*` | `https://whispering.epicenter.so` |
| `https://whispering.bradenwong.com/*` | `https://epicenter.so/whispering` |
| `https://whispering.epicenterhq.com/*` | `https://whispering.epicenter.so` |

Use the product page for old marketing/download links. Use the web app only when the old URL was already an app URL.

## Cloudflare Setup

The repo script manages the Cloudflare pieces for zones listed in `scripts/cf/apply.ts`. It currently covers:

- `getwhispering.com`
- `www.getwhispering.com`
- `whispering.studio`
- `www.whispering.studio`

Each managed redirect lives next to its zone in `ZONES` under a `redirects` field, so adding a redirect for a new zone is a single inline edit.

Preview the changes:

```bash
bun run cf:plan
```

Apply them:

```bash
bun run cf:apply
```

The script creates proxied placeholder DNS records (reserved IP `192.0.2.1`, RFC 5737) for redirect-only hosts, then upserts Cloudflare Single Redirect rules in the `http_request_dynamic_redirect` phase. This is required because Redirect Rules only run when traffic reaches Cloudflare's proxy.

Apex hostnames with an existing SPF or other TXT record are fine: only conflicting `A`, `AAAA`, or `CNAME` records block redirect setup, and the script reports them with enough detail to reconcile in the dashboard.

The token behind `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_TOKEN` needs these zone-level scopes on every zone in the account:

- `Zone:Read`
- `Zone Settings:Edit`
- `DNS:Edit`
- `Dynamic Redirect:Edit`

Older Cloudflare docs (and the URL forwarding pages) call the last one `Single Redirect:Edit`. It's the same permission and the same API surface (`/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets` in the `http_request_dynamic_redirect` phase); the dashboard UI just relabeled it. If you cannot find it under the redirects/rules category, use the dashboard search box for `redirect`. `Account Rulesets:Edit` at account scope works as a fallback.

## Manual Fallback

In Cloudflare, configure redirects on the zone that receives the old traffic, not on the destination zone.

For each old zone:

1. Make sure the hostname has a proxied DNS record. Redirect Rules only run after the request reaches Cloudflare's proxy.
2. Go to `Rules` -> `Redirect Rules`.
3. Create a rule matching the old hostnames.
4. Set status code `301`.
5. Set the target URL to `https://epicenter.so/whispering` or `https://whispering.epicenter.so`.
6. Keep query strings only if they carry useful campaign data. Otherwise drop them.

For `getwhispering.com`, one expression can cover both apex and `www`:

```txt
(http.host eq "getwhispering.com" or http.host eq "www.getwhispering.com")
```

For `whispering.studio`:

```txt
(http.host eq "whispering.studio" or http.host eq "www.whispering.studio")
```

For old subdomains like `whispering.bradenwong.com` and `whispering.epicenterhq.com`, add redirect rules in the parent zones (`bradenwong.com` and `epicenterhq.com`). If those zones are not in this Cloudflare account, configure the same 301 at their DNS/hosting provider instead. To manage them from `scripts/cf/apply.ts`, add the parent zone to `ZONES` with a `redirects` field describing the rule.

## Verification

After changing Cloudflare, check each old URL:

```bash
curl -I https://getwhispering.com
curl -I https://www.getwhispering.com
curl -I https://whispering.studio
curl -I https://www.whispering.studio
curl -I https://whispering.bradenwong.com
curl -I https://whispering.epicenterhq.com
```

Each response should be `301` with a `Location` header pointing at the expected Epicenter URL.
