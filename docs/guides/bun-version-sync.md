# Syncing Tool Versions Across Local and CI

We had Bun version drift: `package.json` said 1.3.0, local had 1.3.1, and CI used `latest`. Not a crisis, but annoying when debugging CI failures that work locally.

We also had Node drift: GitHub runner images can lag behind framework requirements, and Astro requires Node 22.12 or newer. Keep Node pinned to a concrete even LTS major so deploys do not depend on whichever runtime the runner image happens to expose.

## What We Had Before

The workflows were inconsistent:

```yaml
# Some workflows used an env variable
env:
  BUN_VERSION: 'latest'

- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version: ${{ env.BUN_VERSION }}

# Others just hardcoded "latest"
- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version: latest

# Only format.yml was doing it right
- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version-file: "package.json"
```

Meanwhile `package.json` had `"packageManager": "bun@1.3.0"` which nobody was reading except one workflow.

## The Fix

Make `package.json` the single source of truth for Bun.

In `package.json`:
```json
"packageManager": "bun@1.3.3"
```

In every GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
- name: Setup Bun
  uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
  with:
    bun-version-file: "package.json"
```

These workflows and actions now read pinned tool versions:
- `deploy.cloudflare.yml`
- `deploy.cloudflare-preview.yml`
- `ci.format.yml`
- `release.whispering.yml`
- `pr-preview.whispering.yml`
- `.github/actions/setup-whispering-build/action.yml`

Now when you want to upgrade Bun, change one line in `package.json` and everything follows.

Make `.nvmrc` the single source of truth for Node.

In `.nvmrc`:
```text
24
```

In every GitHub Actions workflow or composite action that runs Node-based frontend tooling:
```yaml
- name: Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v6
  with:
    node-version-file: ".nvmrc"
```

Now when you want to upgrade Node, change `.nvmrc` and the workflows follow. Avoid `lts/*` here: it can resolve differently over time, and odd-numbered Node releases are not a stable deployment baseline.

## Pro Tip

The `oven-sh/setup-bun` action reads the version from your `packageManager` field automatically. No need to hardcode versions in workflow files or maintain a separate `.bun-version` file.

This also works with `.tool-versions` if you're using asdf, but `package.json` is already there so why add another file.
