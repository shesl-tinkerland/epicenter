# Scripting

A script is a Bun file that reads the local SQLite materializer and writes through `connectDaemonActions`. There is no `script.ts` recipe to copy. The daemon is the single writer; the script is a short-lived reader plus an IPC client.

Mount names come from the `Mount.name` values default-exported by `epicenter.config.ts`, not from project folders or local module filenames. One daemon process can serve many mounts, and the script chooses one with `connectDaemonActions({ mount })`.

## The whole shape

```ts
import {
	connectDaemonActions,
	findProjectRoot,
	openWorkspaceSqlite,
} from '@epicenter/workspace/node';
import { FUJI_ID, type FujiActions } from '@epicenter/fuji';

const projectDir = findProjectRoot();

// reads: open the materializer read-only
const db = openWorkspaceSqlite(projectDir, FUJI_ID);
const urgent = db.query('SELECT * FROM entries WHERE tag = ?').all('urgent');

// writes: typed proxy over unix socket to the daemon
const fuji = await connectDaemonActions<FujiActions>({
	mount: 'fuji',
	projectDir,
});
for (const note of urgent) {
	await fuji.entries_update({ id: note.id, tags: ['triaged'] });
}

db.close();
```

That is the whole API. No machine auth in the script process, no encryption setup, no Y.Doc reconstruction, no WebSocket.

## Reads: the SQLite materializer

`openWorkspaceSqlite(projectDir, workspaceId)` returns a `bun:sqlite` `Database` opened against `.epicenter/sqlite/<workspaceId>.db`. `.epicenter/` is generated project data, not a source layout or route registry. The daemon's `attachSqliteMaterializer` keeps that file fresh; the script opens it read-only with `PRAGMA query_only = 1`, so an errant `INSERT` fails at the driver instead of silently diverging.

The materializer is the same SQL surface the daemon serves to the SPA: column-typed rows, FTS5 indexes, normal joins. Query cost is `O(rows-returned)` rather than `O(history)`, so cron jobs do not pay the seconds-of-Y.Doc-replay tax that an in-process snapshot would cost.

For ranked search with snippets, use `openSqliteReader({ filePath: sqlitePath(...) })`; it wraps the same database and exposes a `search()` helper. For typed Drizzle queries, pass the returned `db` to `drizzle(db, { schema })` (the per-app schema lives in the app's npm package).

## Writes: typed actions through the daemon

`connectDaemonActions<TActions>({ mount, projectDir })` returns a typed proxy. `mount` is the mount name (`'fuji'` for the Fuji example); the proxy translates `fuji.entries_update({ ... })` into a `POST /run` over the daemon's Unix socket in the OS runtime directory. The daemon invokes the action in-process against the live Y.Doc and returns a JSON `Result<T>`.

The mount name comes from the `Mount.name` field on the value `epicenter.config.ts` default-exports. App-package factories like `fuji()` carry their canonical name internally.

Two consequences fall out:

- **Strong read-after-write happens inside the action.** If a script wants the side effect to be visible to its next read, it should await the action result rather than reading SQLite again immediately. The action handler sees fresh in-memory state; the materializer is eventually consistent.
- **Type safety is opt-in.** `TActions` is the registry type the app's npm package exports (`FujiActions`, `HoneycrispActions`, etc.). The runtime never imports app code into the script process; only the type information flows across.

`projectDir` defaults to `findProjectRoot()`, which walks up from `process.cwd()` looking for `epicenter.config.ts`. Pass an explicit `projectDir` to opt out (cron jobs that run from `/` should).

## What if the daemon is not running?

Reads succeed: SQLite is just a file on disk, opening it does not require any running process.

Writes fail with `DaemonError.Required` because `connectDaemonActions` first does a health check against the socket and surfaces a clear error when no daemon is listening. There is no auto-spawn from the script process; explicit lifecycle is the contract. Start one with `epicenter daemon up` before running the script.

A script that only reads should not call `connectDaemonActions` at all. A script that only writes still needs the daemon up, but does not need to open SQLite. Compose the two when both are needed.
